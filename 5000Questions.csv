0,academia, I am a postdoc and with my former PhD adviser have won a paper award which includes a sizable prize k I am the first author on the paper and he is the second The work is entirely mine but he has been an excellent second author and mentor throughout this project and paper providing active feedback and many excellent suggestions along the way  Both of us will travel to the conference related to the award and both of us already have our travel paid for by grants At the conference we will give a presentation talking about the background of the paper in which I will be the principal speaker The question is this how do we split the award or do we split it at all Please note that this is similar to the following thread but the roles have been changed somewhat Share prize money from conference presentation award with coauthors

2,academia, I have sent the solutions of some assignments to the students of my class One of my students sent me a message that reads as follows not greeting or anything no closing just the following   The proposed solution of Exercise X is obviously wrong because of reason blah blah An appropriate solution to your exercise would be such and such  Now the student in essence is actually correct there is a slight error but it does not alter the essence of the solution It is just a small wording issue that might raise some confusion but the calculations are clear What troubles me is the attitude which I found kind of offensive but I might be wrong  Is it appropriate a student to behave like that What would be the right approach to deal with this student I answered as politely as I could that the student is right thanked the student for spotting it and updated the solution manual But I feel that the student would create similar issues and make similar comments if some typos are found in subsequent notes Note The actual problem might be that the student might start badmouthing me to other studentsprofessors and this might negatively influence other students in believing that I am doing a bad job and consequently this could be reflected on my teaching evaluations given also that I try to get tenured Maybe I am paranoid hope so but in relatively small classes where everyone knows each other the power of badmouthing can be great I want a way to a avoid confrontation and b make it clear that these issues are completely minor they are and not worthy of such aggressive which they might not be but I do not want to take chances messages

7,academia, Ill try to make my situation as clear as possible I have just started a parttime PhD I did a parttime masters degree over two years previously to that In the first year of my masters I worked three days a week and in the second year of my masters I worked five days a week I found working five days a week and doing a parttime masters degree to be completely doable because of how my units were spread out Im married but I have no kids and my wife is also an academic which helps a lot Basically in the evenings and weekends I do little else but academic stuff I have the time for it When I wrote my PhD application I said I would work parttime during the degree however I havent managed to get this in place and am still working fulltime for financial reasons I spoke to my PhD supervisor today who seemed quite concerned that I was working fulltime and said I shouldnt mention it to the doctoral school and strongly encouraged me to go parttime by this time next year  My supervisors saying I shouldnt mention my fulltime work to the doctoral school has really concerned me If they find out though I dont know how they would would I be struck off the PhD On the one hand I am at this stage totally confident that I can do a parttime PhD and work full time On the other Im quite an honest person and dont like the fact that I may be keeping something from the doctoral school I will take my supervisors advice and not say anything though she did advise me to mention it to the head of department at some point but whats the worst that could happen since I am confident of my situation Is my concern paranoia or is it justified EDIT Im in the UK and in the arts I also get on very well with my dept staff if that helps at all and am at the same institution for PhD as I was for masters

10,academia, Ive heard different takes on what the convention is when an Assistant or Associate Professor does not achieve tenure Can you just remain at your existing position and continue to teach and conduct research Can you reapply for tenure again later Is it more conventional to leave the institution for another tenuretrack position at another institution This is in regard to US universities but perhaps an answer articulating what is common in different countries is best

22,academia, I’m an undergraduate student and I find that multiple times each week I have an obsessive need to make sure something I’m doing is allowedaccepted  I do this by asking the TAProfessor for my course in question  It’s usually situations where it’s almost certain that something I’m doing is ethical but I feel the need to ask for each instance if the professor did not explicitly state the rules Some examples  A little while back I asked my professor if thesauruses were allowed and if I had to cite them  Based on common sense I was over  sure it was fine – even on the university library website links were given to a few online thesauruses  When I asked my prof he said that it was absolutely fine and that thesauruses did not have to be cited My professor for another course mentioned that certain calculators were not allowed on tests the kind of calculator I currently have  I wondered if I could still use my calculator on assignments and I assumed I probably could since he only mentioned tests  I asked the TA about it and he said I could I was wondering if I could use my course notes while doing an assignment  I was always allowed to do this in high school and I was   certain it would be okay  I asked the TA about it and he replied that it’s completely okay  I want to earn a degree that was done in perfect ethical standing  I feel that if I don’t ensure every single thing I’m doing is completely ethical then inevitably a few of my actions will be unethical over the four years I don’t want to have to keep pestering my professors about every single detail as it wears on me and also I’m sure will wear on them  At the same time I have the problem I discussed above  Should I just accept that its pretty much impossible for anyone to finish a degree with a  ethical standing  Any adviceexperience would be greatly appreciated

27,academia, A study compared two groups differing on factor A on ability X and found that X differs between the two groups effect of A However the groups also differ on a not interesting variable B say age When using B as covariate in the analysis of A on X there is no effect of A In the statistical analysis ANCOVA the authors present the statistics for X corrected for B ie no significant effect of A on X however next to this analysis they present the effect sizes Cohens d of the rawuncorrected values of X as support for their hypothesis large effect of A on X They do not attempt to make it obvious that these effect sizes are based on scores without correcting for B I think they have to present the effect sizes of A corrected for B ie after regressing out the effect of B on X However they dont want to possibly because they have a strong hypothesis about A affecting X Is what they are doing correct is it normal is it misleading or even fraud

42,academia, Im currently finishing a BSc Honours in Canada and Im applying to Edinburgh among other places to do a Masters They have two researchbased degrees and I was wondering if people with experience in academics and CS could help me distinguish between the two Im not overly familiar with the British Education system The MSc is a oneyear degree of independent research with very little to no classes The MPhil is a twoyear degree where classes are taken in addition to independent research In particular Im wondering  Which is considered more academic or more prestigious Which would be better for getting into a PhD program Since there arent classes in the MSc are you expected to have a higher level of knowledge coming in  
43,academia, I received reviews of my manuscript for IEEE Transactions One question from a reviewer about a common misconception regarding the technology is interesting but is not relevant anywhere else in the paper So my supervisor suggested that I add a new section after the conclusions titled Further Discussion I was just wondering if it is common practice to have such a section

45,academia, Im teaching a lot of students who are fairly unresponsive in a large class that is set early in the morning While Im working on ways to encourage them to respond to questions I find that normal indicators of how one is doing are absent they dont laugh at jokes groan interrupt or give much indication at all of how they are finding the content If I ask if people understand or have questions I will get no responses While I find this somewhat discouraging a more pressing issue is that I find it hard to work out if they are actually understanding what Im saying or perhaps they understand but disagree Possibly they are bored or tired as it is early Presumably Ill get feedback at the end of the course but Id rather fix any issues now rather than later  When trying to evaluate myself I think I might rush sentences and use too many crutch words but I dont know if this is an issue for students If it is they are highly unlikely to say as much to my face at least It is even hard to gauge their prior knowledge and what sort of level of terminology I can assume will be understood For throwaway comments I can give synonyms or quick explanations but doing this constantly will slow things down a lot and will be tiresome for those who already understand these terms I dont want to send out a question which essentially amounts to do I suck 
46,academia, I currently have four sections   Education  Academic and research experiences  Honors and Awards  Work and Volunteer Experience  I have the following questions  Should I include a section which gives a detailed account for the advanced math courses I have taken Should I elaborate on  and  or do I just list my awards and experience in those sections without explaining anything Should I include my research interest and standardized test scores in my CV  
47,academia, I emailed a professor about a postdoc position three weeks ago He replied me on Friday that week and showed his interest I answered his question about partial funding in the new email but have not heard from him since then Its been two weeks and I think its time to send a followup email Im not sure how to write the subject line Should I forward the previous email and write subject like this Followup about postdoc position Thanks a lot Im a little nervous about the position and hope I can get it 
48,academia, I am subscribed to the arXiv daily digests for my subject area I find myself every day doing the following when I get to work  Browsing through the arXiv email and rightclicking on the articles of interest to me to open each of the pages in a different tab in my browser  For each of these pages downloading the pdf by clicking on the link renaming it articletitle by author namespdf and saving the pdf in a directory on my PC  the directory is then automatically synched to my tablet during the day  Looking at the articles on my commute home on my tablet I am bored of doing  It only takes  seconds per article depending on things like how many carriage returns or inappropriate characters I have to remove from the cutandpasted article title and author names  eg math characters I am a mathematician and symbols in titles do not cut and paste well but when Im interested in  articles and one has a lengthy title with carriage returns and symbols in my mind wanders and I start thinking about whether this has already been automated by someone because it seems to me that there would be no obstruction to doing so in theory but I would not be capable of doing it myself Does such an automation exist 
49,academia, I have completed my Msc degree and I proposed an invention based on my thesis subject before I had defended my thesis but I have not registered it till now My professor offered me to fabricate the device that I had proposed both with him and a professor at a foreign university He told me that I needed to form a research group consists of  people we two and a professor and a student at a foreign university I am required to do the half of the job along with my professor and the other half at the foreign university which I am going to find The whole process is supposed to take  year and is fully funded At the time I am planning to apply for a PhD position at a foreign university too Can I apply to the same professor for a PhD position who I am going to work with him on this project Is it constructive and has a positive effect on my application process If yes could you please tell me how can I explain the situation to a professor to persuade him to work with me I mean let me know how can I take the advantage of this project on my application process Any advice or possible email content would be welcome Thanks in advance 
50,academia, I am the professor in charge of a firstyear course for undergraduates Recently I received an email from a student the general meaning of which is the following  Dear professor I am sorry for missing the last few lectures and assignments   During the last few weeks I was really sick with the flu   Could you please help me to get right on track with the class  How should I respond to this email Should I give the student an opportunity to make up the missed assignments or should I give the student zeros for the missed assignments 
51,academia, I currently have four sections   Education  Academic and research experiences  Honors and Awards  Work and Volunteer Experience  I have the following questions  Should I include a section which gives a detailed account for the advanced math courses I have taken Should I elaborate on  and  or do I just list my awards and experience in those sections without explaining anything Should I include my research interest and standardized test scores in my CV  
52,academia, Im teaching a lot of students who are fairly unresponsive in a large class that is set early in the morning While Im working on ways to encourage them to respond to questions I find that normal indicators of how one is doing are absent they dont laugh at jokes groan interrupt or give much indication at all of how they are finding the content If I ask if people understand or have questions I will get no responses While I find this somewhat discouraging a more pressing issue is that I find it hard to work out if they are actually understanding what Im saying or perhaps they understand but disagree Possibly they are bored or tired as it is early Presumably Ill get feedback at the end of the course but Id rather fix any issues now rather than later  When trying to evaluate myself I think I might rush sentences and use too many crutch words but I dont know if this is an issue for students If it is they are highly unlikely to say as much to my face at least It is even hard to gauge their prior knowledge and what sort of level of terminology I can assume will be understood For throwaway comments I can give synonyms or quick explanations but doing this constantly will slow things down a lot and will be tiresome for those who already understand these terms I dont want to send out a question which essentially amounts to do I suck

62,academia, How could we correct the missing citation counts and the missing citing References in the adsabsharvard For example I find that other resources such as httpsinspirehepnet that have much precise and better citation counts while both the Google Scholar and adsabsharvard misses some citation countsmissing citing References  These three resources have their own advantages and disadvantages  Google Scholar Google scholar miss citations from arXiv sometimes but not always  adsabsharvard In principle it counts everything in arXiv but even if so the bib format citations may be missing  perhaps it is the LaTex generating issue  httpsinspirehepnet it only counts articles that are relevant to particle physics highenergy theory quantum field and string theory It misses other disciplines such as AtomicMolecule Optics or Condensed Matter physics  I am happy to receive comments from experts working in all disciplines

178,aviation, A clock is required for IFR flights in the US but any clock doesnt do the clock should be the one mounted on the instrument panel Whats the idea behind this requirement Is it because random clocks the pilots might carry with them for their flights cannot be trusted 
179,aviation, I am not able to decide which airfoil to choose for my UAV project as I am confused I need to lift at least kg of extra payload excluding the weight of the fuselage I can afford a wingspan of m with a cruising speed of at least kmph Also I would like to know if there is any software or application to decide the airfoil for me 
180,aviation, Related to this question regarding flight attendants continuing to stand during turbulence  My understanding is that it is the law for passengers to be seated with their belts fastened during taxitakeofflanding along with the flight attendants  At other times during the flight the fasten seatbelt sign is also illuminated at times of turbulenceexpected turbulence as per the question linked above and usually accompanied by a warning from the captain that theyre expecting turbulence  I assume this is subject to the same rules that insist passengers are actually seated during these periods  On several recent flights on budget airlines RyanairEasyJet Ive begun to notice that the crew are using the fasten seatbelt sign in order to ensure passengers are seated whilst theyre serving fooddrinks etc This was confirmed when I was sat at the front of the plane and over heard the cabin crew discussing this  Clearly there is a good rationale for keeping passengers seated whilst hot drinks are being served as the aisles on budget planes are too narrow to easily squeeze past but on RyanairEasyJet flights there are also significant times when cabin crew are simply trying to flog cheap perfume and scratch cards  During these recent flights where the fasten seatbelt sign was illuminated unnecessarily for long periods of time passengers begun to simply ignore the signs in order to make use of the toilets especially people with young children etc Are there rules that govern when pilotscrew may illuminate the fasten seatbelt signs and are the passengers breaking any laws by ignoring them  
181,aviation, On commercial flights pilots are usually required to have different meal to reduce the chance of food poisoning affecting both pilots Is this just a precautionary measure or has this actually occurred 
182,aviation, The US airway system uses a single transition level or altitude but some other countries like China separate a transtion altitude and a transition level with the transition layer in between  Could anybody kindly explain why they use this type of separate transition system I can guess its there to prevent possible midair collisions between two aircraft using two different altimeter settings QNH and QNE but I dont understand how exactly that works 
183,aviation, I was wondering if there are regulations for when a flight requires both a pilot and copilot I always assumed a copilot is required once civilian passengers are aboard but when I recently was a passenger in SouthAfrican and SouthAmerican sight seeing flights the pilot was always flying alone Flights in europe however always had a pilot and copilot Is this regulated by laws or can the pilot  airline company decide it on their own 
184,aviation, Why dont modern planes and ATC centers have goodquality audio for communication For example in this video    Or basically any other example of pilot communicationsome are worse some are better    This is not terribly bad of course but this is comparable to a cheap  headset the sound is so distorted This can cause trouble when a pilot does not understand some words and asks to repeat the sentence And even more problems if the pilot or flight dispatcher are not native English speakers   Is there some technical reason behind this like antennasignal limitations within the plane The quality is the same when the pilot is just taxiing on the ground so I suppose this has nothing to do with speed or altitude   PS This question is somewhat similar but it is about the PA system for passengers I am talking about pilotATC communication  UPDATE Though I acceptedhonestly  by peer pressure answer from TomMcW who gave quite good technical details on this subject I personally like the answer by Anthony X who pointed out very important fact that the systems should be changed everywhere worldwide in a very short time period and that is what probably the reason no major changes were made during last couple of decades So I suggest to read his answer too not only topvoted one

189,aviation, Can someone explain the design of glider wing airfoils and the subsequent pressure distribution over them I hypothesize that  The pressure distribution should form a resultant force in the forward upward direction since two components of force are required to maintain equilibrium in the flight of a glider a lift  in equal opposition to weight and b a forward component of the total reaction generated by the airfoil  in opposition to drag Thus I conclude that the angle of attack of a glider airfoil relative to flight direction would be negative in order to achieve a forward component opposing drag although it would be positive relative to airflow such as to generate low pressure over the wings Either that or the camber is designed such that the two mentioned criterias here a and b are upheld  Should there not be any opposition to drag I would expect to see the glider decelerate in the forward direction until the airflow stalls over the wings and the glider loses lift and falls I am also curious to know about the various designs of glider airfoils a what are the criterias defining them and b how do they differ from those of powered aircraft if there are any differences at all

267,blender,  So I was asking for some advice and I got this  retopo this immediately its abysmal Use low poly to drive a subdiv or multires and add geometry as needed Its literally unworkable at this stage  Of course I now know that I shouldnt have started with a UV sphere but it was kinda too late and only really cause some invisible problem on the top Its my first model of this kind I only have h of blender thx steam for the counter The vertex painting is of course horrible and its just a visual guide and will be deleted ASAP What my friendly reviewer didnt tell me is why and if I retopo the model I wont Ill restart from scratch what must be done in order to not be a disaster I tried hard and spend many hours trying to keep the quads clean instead of hacking my way with the sculpt tool and dynatopo If I just wanted to sculpt I would have used oculus medium but I want to learn blender too I wasnt quite ready for such a hard comment but I got over it it was yesterday My problem is if I had to do it again I would do it the same way I would start with a quad sphere instead of a UV sphere but thats all and its apparently the wrong way And I cant imagine any other way to do it I understand also it has too many polygons I started with a lower resolution but once the general shape was complete I applied the subsurface modifier and started refining the model and this is whats shown in the picture I shouldnt have applied the subsurface but Im not sure its what makes it abysmally bad Therefore whats wrong with the topology and how to not repeat the same mistakes whatever they are  Thank you EDIT  Im asking this because Im stuck in my process now Because I know Im doing something incorrectly but I dont know why its incorrect

327,blender, I am trying to create a specific shape consisting of two curves connected together by faces in the context of modelling a plane Here is what I came up with by converting the first curve to a mesh extruding to get the second curve and applying some transforms rotating and scaling  The problem I have is that because the scaling is not uniform on all the axes I get nonplanar quads which get triangulated by Cycles  I thought of different ways of fixing this  Creating and converting the two curves separately gives a similar result Dividing the quads by adding intermediate curves makes the quads flatter but it is not perfect  I know that it is mathematically possible for instance if the algorithm converting a curve to a mesh divided the curve into segments according only to the angle and not the distance between vertices so thats why Im asking does anyone know how to do this the right way Thanks

344,blender, I scaled the standard cube to be  x  x  created several copies of it and moved these around so that they should not topple over according to the laws of physics for the following reason   The center of gravity COG of the top brick is at x   the second brick extends from x   to  hence should nicely carry the top brick  The COG of the top two bricks together is at x      the third brick extends from  to  hence should nicely carry the top two bricks  The COG of the top three bricks is at x       the fourth brick extends from  to  hence should nicely carry the top three bricks  The COG of the top four bricks is at x         the fifth brick extends from  to  hence should nicely carry the top four bricks  The COG of the top five bricks is at x          the sixth brick extends from  to  hence should nicely carry the top five bricks  The COG of all six bricks is at x           the floor plane extends from x   upward hence should nicely carry the bricks   Nevertheless if I run the animation the bricks start to topple and three of them fall down to negative infinity  Is this a problem of the blender physics engine that it cannot deal with such fragile balancing Or did I do something wrong in the modelling

351,blender, Heres an illustration of what needs to be done  A texture has to be projected from a point in space to a mirror  in the image which will bounce the projection to a surface  Here is the texture that is going to be projected although a real video file is going to be used  The tricky thing is the mirror the surface marked as  in the illustration is not flat but curved as illustrated below  The point is to see how the projected image or video will appear on the final surface  given a projection angle fov and a curved bounce mirror This is for a video for a project where I need to illustrate how a curved mirror deforms a projection from a video projector laser projector and such and in the animation the shape of the mirror gradually changes via shapekeys which in turn changes the size and deformation of the projected imagevideo If Blender can do this somewhat accurately I can use it for simulations as well which is a plus because of the superior render quality compared to specialized CAD programs Also if this is possible with Blender and we have an answer then it makes Blender a powerful tool for people working with video projectors

470,chemistry, Im a collector of historical artifacts and one of the most common methods to preserve them is waxing And one of the best options out there is Renaissance Wax a microcrystalline wax The reason it is considered superior to natural options like beeswax is that it is PH neutral meaning it will not corrode the artifact over time with its acid content My only hesitancy to continue using it would be that it is petroleum based Im curious if any natural waxes offer the PH neutrality that RW does as well as being just as long lasting for protecting items from moisture

552,chess, In lower level chess matches I often find myself in closed positions where black and whites knights are restricted bishops cant be used for attack and rooks are locked behind your pawn structure What tips do you have to play in this position or is it better to play more aggressive and avoid this position all together I interpret Closed Position as being where major pieces are developed behind the pawn structure where both players prioritized positional plays This is an example using the Pirc defense FEN   e d  d Nf  Nc e  Nf a  Be Be  OO OO  h b  a Bb  e Nfd  Bf Nc  Bg Nb  Bd d  Where the next best move would be for to take the e pawn but black decides to advance the dpawn

562,chess, One of the FIDE rules states that if someones flag falls and there exists a legal sequence of moves such that the other player mates the first player then the position is a win for the second player This got me thinking whether this rule can theoretically be hard to enforce for arbiters ie whether it is possible that the arbiter cannot easily decide whether a game is winnable for one side or not   Do there exist hard chess puzzles where the objective is to find a sequence of moves of any length with both sides helping so that one side wins So essentially helpmate puzzles but without specifying the number of moves until mate Or is it always rather straightforward to determine whether from a given position there is a sequence of moves leading to mate  Perhaps one way to make the job for the arbiter difficult is to not keep track of previous moves and then present a position to the arbiter when the flag falls where it is difficult to prove whether one side can legally castle or not or take en passant or not etc  if such positions can only be won when say en passant is available the arbiter or the second player claiming a win on time rather than a draw would have to construct a proof game to show that the game can indeed be won In any case I cannot come up with examples which are hard helpmates of any length but I am in no way an expert when it comes to helpmates Any thoughts or comments are appreciated Edit This question is not about what is sufficient mating material but about whether positions exist for which it is hard to decide if a mating sequence exists This is more in the territory of artificially constructed helpmatesproof game problems than about simple realistic adjournment situations for arbiters

566,chess, FEN    d d c c Nc Nf Nf  Here we reach slav defense main line and theory goes with e As a way to avoid theory as black I used to play in blitz g goes with bishop fianchetto and castle As white Im a d player and although not many people deviate e with g this could happen Searching in professional games I didnt see many games with g My question is How white proceed after g there must be a reason why professionals rare play this move 
567,chess, I am a d player as white and I really dont like to memorize tatical lines in the opening altought I know most commons lines very well in the first    moves depend on the opening based on my practice I am looking for positional principles that can guide my play Do you have any line that you memorize few principles and you can guess some theory based on this considerations or guide your play after your theory knowledge ends Please point out what positional rules you follow For example someone teached me that queens indian is a fight for the control of e square  When I am playing with white and my theory knowledge ends or black play an unknown variation I always check if I can break on ee and if I could usually is a good move When I am playing with black the same line and I reach a point where my theory knowledge ends and I dont know what to play I always check if it is possible to overcontrol e  So the positional principle control of e helps me a lot in queens indian when my theory knowledge ends or my opponent make an unusual move Another example that come in my mind is when you reach common positions of benoni black will try to play cc and put a knight on d but if black play this allow white to play knight fdc and this fight guide my play in both sides of this variation and after I understand that I became stronger in both sides of this variation A last example that I can give is the almost sure f by black in KID and petrosian variation of KID is a line that is not usually good for black force f Even fischer lose a beautiful game for tal insisting in playing f in this line So this change in blacks way to think the KID can be very annoying even for stronger players I usually do so well with this variation based that black side of KID usually will force f and petrosian variation make it so difficult 
568,chess, I know daily tactics training is very beneficial  However what is the best way to do so Lets say I have  minutes a day  Is it better I do  puzzles in detail spend  minutes on each analysing each move in and ensuring I get the puzzle correct or is it better to do  puzzles each one based off only a few seconds of thought however at the same time seeing many more positions Also is it better to see many new tactics like chess tempo or to get a book and do the same  puzzles until you get them all right

573,chess, I understand the theory and have seen examples of endgames where a pawn promoted to a queen creates a draw and instead the player typically promotes to rook My question is has this ever occurred in a game at the international level Instances of a pawn promoted to a knight would be interesting but not really the target of this question I am interested in notable games where a pawn was promoted to either a rook or a bishop

717,codegolf, Introduction In our recent effort to collect catalogues of shortest solutions for standard programming exercises here is PPCGs first ever vanilla FizzBuzz challenge If you wish to see other catalogue challenges there is Hello World and Is this number a prime Challenge Write a program that prints the decimal numbers from  to  inclusive But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz” For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz” Output The output will be a list of numbers and Fizzes Buzzes and FizzBuzzes separated by a newline either n or rn A trailing newline is acceptable but a leading newline is not  Apart from your choice of newline the output should look exactly like this   Fizz  Buzz Fizz   Fizz Buzz  Fizz   FizzBuzz   Fizz  Buzz Fizz   Fizz Buzz  Fizz   FizzBuzz   Fizz  Buzz Fizz   Fizz Buzz  Fizz   FizzBuzz   Fizz  Buzz Fizz   Fizz Buzz  Fizz   FizzBuzz   Fizz  Buzz Fizz   Fizz Buzz  Fizz   FizzBuzz   Fizz  Buzz Fizz   Fizz Buzz  Fizz   FizzBuzz   Fizz  Buzz Fizz   Fizz Buzz  The only exception to this rule is constant output of your languages interpreter that cannot be suppressed such as a greeting ANSI color codes or indentation Further Rules  This is not about finding the language with the shortest approach for playing FizzBuzz this is about finding the shortest approach in every language Therefore no answer will be marked as accepted Submissions are scored in bytes in an appropriate preexisting encoding usually but not necessarily UTF Some languages like Folders are a bit tricky to scoreif in doubt please ask on Meta Nothing can be printed to STDERR Unlike our usual rules feel free to use a language or language version even if its newer than this challenge If anyone wants to abuse this by creating a language where the empty program generates FizzBuzz output then congrats for paving the way for a very boring answer Note that there must be an interpreter so the submission can be tested It is allowed and even encouraged to write this interpreter yourself for a previously unimplemented language If your language of choice is a trivial variant of another potentially more popular language which already has an answer think BASIC or SQL dialects Unix shells or trivial Brainfuck derivatives like Alphuck and  consider adding a note to the existing answer that the same or a very similar solution is also the shortest in the other language Because the output is fixed you may hardcode the output but this may not be the shortest option You may use preexisting solutions as long as you credit the original author of the program Standard loopholes are otherwise disallowed  As a side note please dont downvote boring but valid answers in languages where there is not much to golf these are still useful to this question as it tries to compile a catalogue as complete as possible However do primarily upvote answers in languages where the authors actually had to put effort into golfing the code Catalogue   var QUESTIONIDvar ANSWERFILTERtIWYnsLAZletQKqrVveCRJfxcRLevar COMMENTFILTERQBAkjfAiUXmdBoYkvar OVERRIDEUSERvar

718,codegolf, Challenge Write a function which takes one parameter an integer t Your function has to stop your program for t seconds before continuing similar to timesleept in Python and WAIT t in BBC BASIC You must not use any built in waiting functions or any built in functions for executing code after a certain time and your program must resume after t seconds For testing your function there is tolerance of  seconds more or less than the given t on your own machine variances between computers are fine If your answer is challenged by anyone you must provide photographic screenshotted proof that your function works correctly for t t and t You may also provide the details of your computer so people can try to replicate it on their own machine Your program should and will be run on a computer whose clock speed is  GHz or higher Winning The shortest program wins Bounty A bounty will go out to the shortest program which stops the program without using a loop checking how much time

719,codegolf, Introduction Cacti come in various different sizes shapes and colors However the most iconic cactus and musthave in every Western has to be the saguaro Important features are its size and arms which have defined the stereotypical cactus appearance   Your task is to bring the saguaro in the ASCII world However  as in the real world  no saguaro is like another so your program has to be able to generate saguaros with varying arm configurations An example saguaro   Input b b   in decimal input length of                                                                                                                                       Specifications A saguaro always has a base and a top with variable amounts of stem in between The stem parts can have no arms an arm on the right one on the left or two arms   Saguaro growth patterns are given as an input list containing twobit values  means no arms  an arm on the right  an arm on the left and  two arms all in binary The input lists length determines the saguaros height   Saguaro sections look like the following Cactus parts are surrounded by octothorps  for clarity which shall not be printed A saguaros height is always equal to k characters for nonnegative integers k             Saguaro top                    Stem both arms       Stem id                                      Stem left arm         Stem id                                             Stem right arm         Stem id                                              Stem no arms           Stem id                                                     Saguaro base            Input As previously said the input consists of a list of twobit values     in decimal It can be given in any reasonable format The lists first element corresponds to the saguaros highest stem part the second element to its second highest stem part etc If you want you can require the input lists length as an additional input Please specify it in your answer if you do so Output Your output ASCII saguaro should be built using the exact stem parts as described above Trailing spaces on a line and trailing new lines are ignored you may print more fewer or as many as specified above Rules  Standard loopholes apply This being codegolf a programs byte count should be minimal  Test cases   An outlier Input b b b b                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Alternating arms Input b b b                                                                                                                                                                                                     An abundance of arms Input b b                                                                                                                               No arms also known as a spear Input b                                                                                                           No body some call it a young cactus Input

722,codegolf, Introduction You can skip this part if you already know what a cyclic group is A group is defined by a set and an associative binary operation  that is a  b  c  a  b  c There exists exactly one element in the group e where a  e  a  e  a for all a in the group identity For every element a in the group there exists exactly one b such that a  b  e  b  a inverse For every two elements a b in the group a  b is in the group closure We can write an in place of aaaa The cyclic subgroup generated by any element a in the group is a  e a a a a  an where n is the order size of the subgroup unless the subgroup is infinite A group is cyclic if it can be generated by one of its elements Challenge Given the Cayley table product table for a finite group determine whether or not its cyclic Example Lets take a look at the following Cayley table                                      This is the Cayley table for Dihedral Group  D This is indexed so if we want to find the value of    we look in the fifth column on the third row note that the operator is not necessarily commutative so    is not necessarily equal to    We see here that      also that      We can find  by starting with  and then while the list is unique append the product of the last element and the generator  We get                 We stop here with the subgroup    If you compute  through  youll see that none of the elements in the group generate the whole group Thus this group is not cyclic Test Cases Input will be given as a matrix output as a truthyfalsy decision value   False D   True e   True  i  i   True  i i    True e a with aa   False D ????  True product of cyclic subgroups of order  and  thanks to Zgarb   False Abelian but not cyclic thanks to xnor  You will be guaranteed that the input is always a group You may take input as indexed values

True product of cyclic subgroups of order  and  thanks to Zgarb   False Abelian but not cyclic thanks to xnor  You will be guaranteed that the input is always a group You may take input as indexed values

other catalogue challenges there is Hello World and Is this number a prime Challenge Write a program that prints the decimal numbers from  to  inclusive But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz” For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz” Output The output will be a list of numbers and Fizzes Buzzes and FizzBuzzes separated by a newline either n or rn A trailing newline is acceptable but a leading newline is not  Apart from your choice of newline the output should look exactly like this   Fizz  Buzz

approach in every language Therefore no answer will be marked as accepted Submissions are scored in bytes in an appropriate preexisting encoding usually but not necessarily UTF Some languages like Folders are a bit tricky to scoreif in doubt please ask on Meta Nothing can be printed to STDERR Unlike our usual rules feel free to use a language or language version even if its newer than this challenge If anyone wants to abuse this by creating a language where the empty program generates FizzBuzz output then congrats for paving the way for a very boring answer Note that there must be an interpreter so the submission can be tested It is allowed and even encouraged to write this interpreter yourself for a previously unimplemented language If your language of choice is a trivial variant of another potentially more popular language which already has an answer think BASIC or SQL dialects Unix shells or trivial Brainfuck derivatives like Alphuck and  consider adding a note to the existing answer that the same or a very similar solution is also the shortest in the other language Because the output is fixed you may hardcode the output but this may not be the shortest option You may use preexisting solutions as long as you credit the original author of the program Standard loopholes are otherwise disallowed  As a side note please dont downvote boring but valid answers in

801,crypto, In RSA you choose npq where p and q are large primes with similar length Then you choose e that is coprime with phin and find d that is modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo phin so ed equiv  mod phin Then med mod n  m for any natural m less than n As far as I have researched it the exponentiation to the power edkphin where k is an integer relies on the Eulers theorem that states aphin equiv  mod n which is true if a is coprime to n This leads me to a question what happens if you choose p as the message Does RSA handle it in any way I would like to know both about Textbook RSA and the Deployed RSA

812,crypto, I am trying to simulate a passphrase attack on a wallet file This wallet file is apparently encrypted as described here    This master key is then encrypted with AESCBC with a key derived from the passphrase using SHA and OpenSSLs EVPBytesToKey and a dynamic number of rounds determined by the speed of the machine which does the initial encryption and is updated based on the speed of a computer which does a subsequent passphrase change Although the underlying code supports multiple encrypted copies of the same master key and thus multiple passphrases the client does not yet have a method to add additional passphrases  I would like to generate keys systematically to decrypt the wallet without knowing the passphrase but am unclear from the description above how the master key is encrypted with a key derived from the passphrase I have looked at the code in the copay codebase but have not found how they are using passphrase to decrypt wallet Can someone clue me in

818,crypto, Im programming a file encryption software based on blowfish which uses bit blocks I will need a mechanism for padding but Im not sure how to implement that properly All of the approaches Ive seen so far could only be applied to text where characters like x cannot contain data and thus can be used for special purposes Since Im planning on encrypting all file types I cannot rely on special characters which could be easily confused with real data Consider ANSI X padding for example how would the decryptor know that the sequence     is not some special data but padding I came up with two of my own solutions but since Im not a cryptoanalyst I dont know how strong they are  The very first byte of the encrypted file will be the padding number the number of actual data bytes in the last block Yes Im giving it away and anyone with a hex editor will be able to see it The last block is padded with random bytes I feel like this is a big weakness since Im not encrypting my padding number Is this really a weakness and why  The very first block of the encrypted file will contain the padding number and a bunch of random bytes The decryptor will know exactly where to find the padding number first byte of the first block Once again the last block is padded with random bytes Is this a good approach  Any other methods I can use Thanks in advance

820,crypto, I was reading obfs protocol specification and there is a vague point in the key stablishment step for me   Key establishment phase The party who opens the connection is the initiator the one who    accepts it is the responder  Each begins by generating a   UniformDH keypair and a random number PADLEN in  MAXPADDING   Both parties then send PUBKEY  WRPADLEN  After retrieving the public key of the other end each party   completes the DH key exchange and generates a sharedsecret for the   session named SHAREDSECRET  As you see above in the first step both the initiator and the responder sends their PUBKEY padded with random length bytes of data to each other  My question is How receivers of these data distinguish other entitys public key from the random padding In the other words is there an delimiter between PUBKEY and the padding data

838,crypto, Consider the following experiment  If we require that operatornamePleft mathcal A text succeeds right  frac for any adversary mathcal A in order to call the scheme Pi perfectly CPA secure can such a scheme exist It would seem like this definition cannot be met since the adversary can use the oracle access to compute textEnckmi for i as many times as necessary until one of them coincides with cleftarrow textEnckmb at which point mathcal A knows what b is Is my thinking correct

892,dba, OK While writing ETL against a development instance of c I was in a cycle of write run fix errors drop database recreate database and rerun ETL  During this evolution I deleted a data file instead of using drop tablespace including contents  yes I know  Seeing that the db wouldnt work I restarted it and saw that all the pluggable databases as well as the container database are now in MOUNTED mode and none are usable  Furthermore the databases are in NOARCHIVE mode so we cant rebuild the data files   Now all the pluggable dbs on the instance are dev dbs so blowing them away is an option but I dont see how I can restart my instance and get any databases to be usable at this point  How can I accomplish this 
893,dba, I am processing messages from a distributed queue that guarantees at least once delivery My strategy for handling duplicate messages has been to use ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING in my inserts I had to convert a few tables in my schema to use table partitioning and a trigger to handle which subtable to direct the insert into The trigger function checks for duplicate entries and performs a RAISE uniqueviolation Unfortunately the ON CONFLICT clause doesnt catch these errors and causes my query to error I can change the trigger to ignore these duplicates internally but I dont want to hide these conflicts from other users of the system  Is there a way to catch a uniqueviolation via ON CONFLICT TLDR How to I RAISE in a trigger that I can handle with ON CONFLICT

899,dba, We host a MongoDB  replica set in AWS with three nodes  a primary secondary failover and an arbiter  Normally if the primary instance dies the failover to the secondary is pretty quick  seconds Today we had a network issue where the MongoDB primary instance lost connectivity with the disk containing the database for about  minutes and CPU IOWait went to   During this time queries to the primary just hung and went into timeout  Probably because the primary was still up though unresponsive the replica set did not failover or even start a vote Is there a configuration which would produce a failover also in such cases  Or is there some ready tools that could force a failover if simple queries to the primary node start taking too long

919,dba, I have created the following query which is used to calculate a total from the results of a spatial query SELECT   SUMmedprice FROM SELECT   STINTERSECTIONageom SELECT     STSETSRIDgeom    FROM cataloguetable   WHERE idnumber      AS geom   smallprice   medprice   largeprice FROM pricingtable AS a WHERE STINTERSECTSSTSETSRIDageom  SELECT   STSETSRIDgeom  FROM cataloguetable WHERE idnumber    AS totalprice  My tables look like this CREATE TABLE pricingtable    gid serial NOT NULL   tileid numeric   smallprice numeric   medprice numeric   largeprice numeric   geom geometryMultiPolygon   And CREATE TABLE cataloguetable    ogcfid serial NOT NULL   geom geometryGeometry   idnumber character varying   scale integer   scalecode character varying   I am trying to modify this query so that it calculates the total price for all rows instead of just a single row with a specific idnumber However whenever I try and modify my query to do this I get  ERROR more than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression SQL state   I really dont know where to go from here Can anyone point me in the right direction Ideally I would like to create a price column on the catalogue table and populate this with calculated prices which depending on the scalecode from the cataloguetable either small medium or large will calculate a total from the relevant column in the pricingtable 
920,dba, So im taking my first steps into deploying an AlwaysOn solution at my company Ive set it up in a test environment so know the setupconfig steps required however what we dont know is how our systems are going to perform once AlwaysOn has been switched on in production as we havent done any performance testing with productionlike load  We have about  databases that need to be synchronized across to DR  totalling around  TB in size This is a data warehousing system and is used for reporting during the day all reads and batch loads at night all writes  We are not using AGs to provide HA  this is for DR across two data centers using asynch mode but with added bonus of up to date readonly data on DR for the analytics team to do their ad hoc analysis without interfering with regular business reporting In a DR scenario failover would be manual Reading posts about AG performance I know there are things we could tweak such as max worker threads and using a separate NIC for mirror traffic to improve performance  so we have options should we run into issues I havent really ever looked into network latencybandwidth performance metrics before so specifics would be helpful How should we run an Availability Groups network test and what network latency or bandwidth numbers should we watch during the test 
921,dba, I have created a maintenance plan to take a full backup of all my databases every Sundays and a differential backup every day Also a log backup is triggered every hour However there is an issue with this schema If I add a new database in the middle of the week the differential and log backup jobs will fail because they are lacking a full backup image I therefore need to be able to take a full backup anytime either the differential or log backup job fails I could for example add a new step to take a full backup in case the previous one fails However this full backup job will run on all my databases but I would like to only take the one that have failed Any way to ask the SQL server to take a full backup of new databases It can right after the database creation or in case a of failure of a differential or log backup job

923,dba, I am studying about Projection index in a datawarehouse According to the paper Indexing Techniques for Data Warehouses Queries by VanichayobonS and GruenwaldL the Projection index on any column in a table stores all the values in that column in the exact same order as in the table I didnt quite understand how is it advantageous copying the SAME COLUMN VALUES in SAME ORDER to the index as querying from the index would take same time as querying from the table as per my understanding and assumption Can anyone throw some light on this

925,dba, I have a query which updates a table with data from another table The current query is written as a correlated update with an exists clause to remove unnecessary rows The problem is since both of these tables are large data marts the query is running real slow I am thinking of using a merge query but are their any performance impacts on running merge query I have read in some places that it is better to use plsql insert and then update vs merge Below are my two queries  Without merge UPDATE T SET A B C     SELECT A B C   FROM T   WHERE TPARTITIONCOLUMNT       AND TID  TID  WHERE EXISTS    SELECT  FROM T   WHERE TPARTITIONCOLUMNT     AND TID  TID  AND PARTITIONCOLUMNT  ABC   With Merge MERGE into T USING    SELECT A B C   FROM T   WHERE TPARTITIONCOLUMNT    SRC ON SRCID  TID AND TPARTITIONCOLUMNT  ABC WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET TA  SRCA TB  SRCB TC  SRCC  By the plan clearly merge performs a lot better But is there any performance implications with merge The tables are large data marts and they dont have primary keys or constraints 
926,dba, Its not an issue for me I was more just looking for an answer as to WHY it does this I have  queries both the same with the exception that one has a where clause in a different place but no so that it should affect the results apologies I deal with sensitive information so these images dont really do this justice Query   Query  Results  Query   Query  Results  I guess you will just have to take my word that both queries are exactly the same aside form the IN statement moving to the top underneath the date query in the first query its at the bottom but there is no subqueries or anything so I dont understand why both queries dont yield the same results lol EDIT  Full queries with changed names  While Rewriting the full query I noticed a hidden OR god this is embarrassing the last line is AND NOT myTablefield LIKE Other Thing OR Some OtherThing  so When I added the line to the bottom it obviously became part of the OR LOL

928,dba, I have a query that looks like select count  FROM joins  WHERE customerid in select id from customer limit  AND  more statements  It involves tables with several hundred million records table sizes around GB including all the indexes The result for  would be a count of  the expected count for  would be  With the limit at  the statement returns in a few hundred milliseconds When I put the limit up to  the query just sits there and doesnt return at all This is using an RDS Postgres instance and running statements through IntelliJ Ive also read around that using large WHERE IN statements arent as performant as joining on the ids through a temporary table instead so Ive edited the statement to use WITH but the same hang between  and  exists I assume Im hitting some constraintlimit with something more to do with hardware than the statement Im just not sure what with Edit When I change the WHERE clause to be WHERE customerid between  and  the query is still really fast and ids between  and  have no gaps Ive also since changed my RDS instance from a medium to an XL and I can now limit from  but  hangs Nothing looks strange from the monitoring

950,dba, We have a sharded mongo cluster with a database per client model Given many roughly same size clients  the default db creation has proven to work well at evenly distributing the load while avoiding multishard queries Up till now all shards were homogeneous SSD based deployments however now we are trying to add heterogeneous larger but slower HDD based shards  so each clients can have few large bulk collections located there while their primary shard stays on SSD This is easliy accomplished with the zoning method  zones hdd and ssd  and would work very well if for one issue TLDR Are there any ways to restrict new database creation to only happen on SSD shards Only way I know of is to let DB creation happen then check where it got created and use movePrimary if it is in wrong zone Issue with this is that process is manual and involves hunting down and restarting every mongos router  as movePrimary was not quite designed to be production ready

953,dba, I make every day at  AM a Full Backup NOT a COPYONLY of a database  GB and every minute from AM till AM a TRANSACTION LOG Backup  When I tried to Restore to a point in Time eg AM there is an error that the backupsets are not inline  When I took a look at the backupset table in msdb database I see all the backups FULL en LOGS but the firstlsn of the First TRNLOG after a FULL Backup is not the same as the lastlsn of the FULL backup but it is the same the lastlsn of Prev TRNLOG which is before the FULL backup  So it is not possible to restore the FULL backup and eg the First TRNLOG backup What is going wrong in my backup process See image below  
954,dba, We are running an Amazon Aurora database that emulates MySQL  The CREATETIME in SHOW TABLE STATUS and INFORMATIONSCHEMATABLES is consistently NULL for all our tables  Is this a bug a limitation of Auroras architecture or am I doing something wrong Is this information available anyplace else  db informationschema SELECT DISTINCT TABLESCHEMA  FROM informationschemaTABLES WHERE CREATETIME IS NOT NULL   TABLESCHEMA          informationschema   mysql                 rows in set  sec  Additional notes We have several thousand tables across several hundred databases on several different hosts many of the tables were created with filespertable on and some with it off We do not have access to the frm files and they may or may not exist in Aurora This has always worked for us in MySQL Update Amazon support told us vaguely this is a bug and it will be corrected in a later release Still interested in knowing if this is going to be retroactively available or if there is another place to get this cause Amazon is not elaborating  
955,dba, In MySQL  I have a table user that contains the columns registered and lastLogin My goal is to group the users by calendar months of registration and then select for each group how many of these users were still active after  month after  months and so on  users have registered in June  from these  have been active in July  or later  have been active in August  or later etc Continue this output for all users registered in the past months until today I understand how I can select any of the activity months by hand for example select all users that were active one calendar month after their registration SELECT yearregistered monthregistered countid FROM user WHERE lastLogin  DATEADDDATESUBdateregistered INTERVAL DAYOFMONTHregistered   DAY INTERVAL  MONTH GROUP BY yearregistered monthregistered  This would give me the number of users who were active one month after their registration or later But in addition I would also like to select the number of users who were active  months after their registration  months after their registration and so on up to the current month The results would be something like this not necessarily look like this but it should get the idea across Columns      Cohort     total   month  months  months    month n                                                                                                                                                     How do I change the query to select all months of activity instead of a specific month 
956,dba, Some developers use SSMS  with dbowner permissions to databases on a shared SQL Server but error logs show an attempted login to the first user database on the instance which they dont have access to The log error is the typical  but the user didnt try to connect to that database I watched Also SSMS clocked for about  seconds when trying to expand the databases folder After some time all the databases on the server were present This hasnt been an issue using SSMS  As a work around we granted connect to all databases for the user which did stop the errors in the log and removed the delay when expanding the database folders but doesnt seem like the long term solution  Does this sound like a SSMS  bug or user permissions Any thoughts Thanks in advance TJ Default db is set to the user database with dbowner permissions This has been tested on different servers with the same login error result and login was to the first user database This is a AD user Error  Severity  State

960,dba, How to check alert log for DB internal errors in Oracle

973,dba, We have a sharded mongo cluster with a database per client model Given many roughly same size clients  the default db creation has proven to work well at evenly distributing the load while avoiding multishard queries Up till now all shards were homogeneous SSD based deployments however now we are trying to add heterogeneous larger but slower HDD based shards  so each clients can have few large bulk collections located there while their primary shard stays on SSD This is easliy accomplished with the zoning method  zones hdd and ssd  and would work very well if for one issue TLDR Are there any ways to restrict new database creation to only happen on SSD shards Only way I know of is to let DB creation happen then check where it got created and use movePrimary if it is in wrong zone Issue with this is that process is manual and involves hunting down and restarting every mongos router  as movePrimary was not quite designed to be production ready

983,diy, The main drain to the sewer in our house is backing up when a lot of water is run in a short time evidenced by water coming up in the tub  We had a sewer scope done when we bought it a month ago and it was clear all the way to the sewer with some minor roots showing at parts  However the sewer scope shows a large portion of the run is filled with water Were unsure if the problem is with the sewer or if the drain has become clogged  We figured wed start by having it roto rootered The bigger part is when the drain backs up water starts dripping from the seal around the hole that was made for the pipe in the exterior basement foundation into the house  I guess this makes sense since the drain is definitely not fully sealed based on the roots in the sewer scope  If the drain stops backing up I imagine we wont see much dripping though when the rainy season really picks up maybe we will but thats a separate issue with the basementfoundation  Since the drain is probably leaking some outside the house does it need to be replaced or if we can solve the blockage with a rooter is that good enough

994,diy, As you can see from my post history I am blessed with a lovely home with aluminum wiring I am also taking steps on every project to review and mitigate the risks of aluminum wiring by using proper pigtails or Alumiconn connectors The authoritative references on aluminum wiring seem to have been written at least a decade ago Have the risks from aluminum wiring been mitigated to any extent by highefficiency fixtures and appliances becoming more common  My thought process is that an LED fixture will generate the same light with significantly less draw This reduced draw reduces the heating and expansion of the wiring The expansion and contraction is what causes the separation in AL and CUAL joins That separation then induces the sparking that gets people hurt My question is entirely focused on theory rather than application Even if modern loads actually reduce the risk it is still imperative to use the correct connectors and strategies with AL wiring Using proper solutions such as crimp connectors AFCI breakers and proper boxing nearly eliminates the risk which is far better than any theoretical reduction

1005,diy, I am new so cant add comments to existing posts it seems but in searching for an answer I found Tester suggested attaching to the chassis I had come to the same conclusion but wasnt willing to risk it without first researching it a bit more In the end I did that and it works However out of over a dozen articles about the C wire that I read it was only here that it was suggested and it happens to be about my specific brandmodel So this makes me want to ask the next logical question Can you assume that on any unit the C Common wire connection can be achieved by connecting to the chassis Or is that a unit specific solution in my case 
1006,diy, Just bought this hammer drill to drill in very hard concrete which it was unable to do What surprises me is that I feel absolutely no difference vibration while holding it sound it makes drilling efficiency between when I set the hammer function or the drilling function The switch to select between hammer and normal drilling is clumsy though Question is it the case that hammer and drilling function should always feel obviously different when using it 
1007,diy, I have a two lamp ballast with two blue one red one white and one black How do I connect that to a one lamp fixture 
1008,diy, I am quite unfamiliar with central heating systems let alone those that use hot water as the heat source so please forgive my clumsy attempt to ask this question I have a First Co Aquatherm Combo Heater that is connected to my tanktype gas water heater  As I understand it hot water is piped in from the water heater to the Aquatherm where it passes through some sort of heat exchanger producing hot air and cool water  My water heater recently failed and I had it replaced  The guys doing the install did not check the heating system after they installed the tank the tech only told me that I might experience some air in our faucets the first time we used the heating system The last time I used the heating system prior to the water heater replacement everything was working fine  granted this was a few month back in spring  With the new water heater we get hot water from the tap but our heating system blows only ambient air  I suspect an issue with the water heater install but my vendor has washed his hands of it and told me that its probably a problem with something in my heating system   Ive traced the lines from the water heater up through the ceiling to the Aquatherm in the attic and from what I can tell they have the connections right  I dont have a way to check that the hot water conduit to the Aquatherm is actually full  My understanding is that the cold water supply provides the pressure for the hot water outlet this was sufficient before the tank install so I would assume its the same now   Are there any other mechanisms by which a new water heater can cause a heating system like mine to fail  Or should I just shell out for maintenance on my heating system 
1009,diy, I had to silicone seal a small gap around bottom joint of our shower screen where it is attached to the wall We realised that a small but steady drip was soaking the floor over time I sealed it fully about pm and it seemed set following morning So I used it but still a small drip was magically seeping through So could this be because after  hours it had not cured properly or more likely I simply did a bad job If it was because it was not properly cured have I now ruined it EIther way can I simply plug in some more or should I start again Thanks for any advice guys

1057,diy, Im installing an air conditioner above a bedroom window but theres no electric outlet nearby Im to avoid running wire along the wall and I noticed that the light fixture receptacle has an empty conduit pointing in the direction of the window  If it reaches the window or close enough to it I could drill near the window and put an outlet there However I have no way of telling if the conduit continues straight ahead or curves to somewhere I put a snake wire in it and it goes in fairly easily more than the distance from the light fixture to the window Is there any way to trace the path of the empty conduit Its embedded in a concrete ceiling about two or three inches deep  
1058,diy, I am preparing to replace most if not all of the wiring in our house  It is old some of it is dangerous and almost none of it is grounded  For some time I have been interested in home automation and one of the things that I would like to accomplish with this electrical refit is to install some consumption monitoring Now I have seen some products that essentially clamp a current meter to the wire coming out of the circuit breaker and then that plugs into a little box that can be queried by software to get current load on the line  This is all well and good but it looks like that gets really crowded in the load center real fast and is really geared toward people who do not want to buy new breakersload center etc I am replacing both and I am on the lookout for some kind of breaker that can not only trip under higher load conditions but also report the load at any given time   I saw these Square D breakers that are part of the Wiser Energy product line but the literature makes it sound like the monitoring they do is specifically for power outage situations where power source needs to be switched from grid to backup or something Has anyone encountered load center and circuit breaker products that meter the current and can report either by custom software or supplied software

1101,dsp, Just to start with some context I work in animal research and I need to play auditory stimuli that consist in sequences of broadband white noise between  and  kHz the spectrum should be attenuated as much as possible outside that range My equipment for the task includes a PC running windows  and matlab with psychtoolbox and signal processing toolbox an ASUS soundcard with sampling rate of kHz fs a couple of cellphone speakers a professional microphone and a National Instruments DAQ card with sampling rate of kHz fs I would like to know if the procedure that I use to calibrate the speakers to produce the desired stimuli is correct or at least acceptable and it case of not being so how could it be improved My description will be quite long and detailed so bare with me please Right now I cant recover the figures from my last calibration but Ill try to submit them soon   White noise generation unfiltered The first thing I do is creating a white noise sequence of the desired length with the available sampling rate of the soundcard The input has to be an amplitude value between  and  the loudness will be calibrated later on Therefore I generate normal random numbers with a std of  truncated at  or  and then I multiply by  to not put the speakers under too much stress which gives me an average maximum loudness of  dB SPL more than enough for my purposes The following code implements this sig  noiseNsamples  function x  noisesigman      range       csqrtsigma     cdfinv  y erfinvyerfcrange  erfcrangec     xcdfinvrandn  end  Then I apply a  ms ramp at the beginning and end of the sound following half a period of the function sinfracx and that is the signal I play and record Lets call that signal sig  Filter for equalization in frequency domain After that I play sig at one of the speakers and I record it with the mic and the NI card at fs Lets call the recorded signal sig Then I calculate its fft which I will use to equalize the signal The idea is that because I want to make the response of the speakers flat for all frequencies I can multiply sig by the inverse of the absolute value of the fft of sig in the frequency domain so when it is played back its response will be flatter In order to improve the estimate of fftsig I select a region of sig well between the beginning and the end then I divide it in chunks and compute the fft for each chunk and finally I average the absolute value After that I interpolate the result to match the frequency bins of fftsig the sounds played are always the same length Therefore I save that result as the frequency response of the filter that achieves the equalization Here is the code snippet that does what I described nint        floorlengthsigtimeconsfs           number of intervals intsamp

try to perform the equalization and the band pass filtering at the same time I generate the white noise first noisebef  noisensampsig  Then I make sure everything is symmetric and has the correct size in frequency domain I select the desired frequencies and cut all the rest directly in frequency domain This is the step Im most concerned about because in principle that sharp cut might introduce some

1108,dsp, i have been seeking for a better Transform than STFT with high overleaping The Transform should more suitble for the human auditory system And i learned that there are at least  Methods i may use like MFCC CQT and CWT Just ignore MFCC and considering of CQT and CWT i have red some paper and thesis but cant really tell which is better Some of the papers i red says that CWT is only special case of CQT and CQT is better Other says CQT is the special case of CWT like this question here Difference between CQT and WT Some Paper said that the CQT is not invertible because some samples never get analysed  So im now confused what is the difference between CQT and CWT Which is better if i need both time and spectral analyse And if im seeking for a good transform for both speech and music analyse which transform would be best for me And a stupid question do these Transforms need overleap in order to get better result

1112,dsp, I am working with machine learning for time series classification I am trying to extract features from the amplitude spectrum My current concern is that I cannot tell the length of the signal in advance Heres one example signal with N observations corresponding to approximately  seconds of data collection  I do not have an upper bound on the length of the signal although more than  observations usually indicate I have an outlier My approach has been to take the input signal xxxldotsxN and then find the onesided amplitude spectrum from its Npoint DFT  mathcalFx  X X ldots XN AXX X ldots XfracN  Given that my sampling rate is approximately fstextHz I figured I would interpolate the onesided amplitude spectrum to  points PS I made a mistake here please see clarification below This procedure gives me a point DFT and a onesided amplitude spectrum with  coefficients which I interpolate to  linear interpolation For comparison heres the original amplitude spectrum and its interpolation The horizontal axis is given in Hz  They dont look very different However the features I take from the spectrum are such as shortterm energy variance standard deviation number of peaks and location of the first peak as well as the magnitude of specific coefficients am I right in saying thats the energy at those bins So different approaches in finding those  coefficients can lead to quite different results Also I have the impression that interpolating the amplitude spectrum is just plain wrong Looking at the figure it seems obvious that the interpolation made me lose a lot of energy content in the range near  Hz For disclosure I did check each related question suggested by Stack Overflow as I wrote mine The most similar question to mine seems to be How to combine bins of my DFT however I believe I have several additional doubtsto start with Im eager for criticism on whether I am doing the right approach in taking the absolute value of the Fourier coefficients and then trying to reduce the number of bins or whether I should zeropad my signal to a number of observations that is a multiple of  and thus hopefully avoid leakage I dont know Im really struggling to understand the subject and I might be working with several misconceptions here any corrections will be appreaciated   PS I made a mistake in my assumptions I incorrectly assumed Matlabs interp function interpolates over a set of query points and averages the values inbetween What it is in fact doing is downsampling  PPS heres the code for coefficient reduction qp    numelX       X  interpX qp

1134,dsp, I have a signal which is bandpassed in the frequencies Hz The original sampling rate was K I tried to down sample the signal to   and  Hz Then I tried to plot the CWT and DWT of each down sampled signal I noticed that for each signal the representation for each level or scale coefficient differs on the other Even though the signal is the same but with different sampling rate I also noticed that for the MATLAB function scalefrq the last parameter is fs and the output of the function is the frequencies fs which doesnt make sense to me Because its well known from Nyquist Theorem the frequencies that contain the power are fs So what am I missing here How does the sampling rate effect on the result of the Wavelet Transform and what is the relation between the Nyquist rate and Wavelet Transform

1153,dsp, I am working with machine learning for time series classification I am trying to extract features from the amplitude spectrum My current concern is that I cannot tell the length of the signal in advance Heres one example signal with N observations corresponding to approximately  seconds of data collection  I do not have an upper bound on the length of the signal although more than  observations usually indicate I have an outlier My approach has been to take the input signal xxxldotsxN and then find the onesided amplitude spectrum from its Npoint DFT  mathcalFx  X X ldots XN AXX X ldots XfracN  Given that my sampling rate is approximately fstextHz I figured I would interpolate the onesided amplitude spectrum to  points PS I made a mistake here please see clarification below This procedure gives me a point DFT and a onesided amplitude spectrum with  coefficients which I interpolate to  linear interpolation For comparison heres the original amplitude spectrum and its interpolation The horizontal axis is given in Hz  They dont look very different However the features I take from the spectrum are such as shortterm energy variance standard deviation number of peaks and location of the first peak as well as the magnitude of specific coefficients am I right in saying thats the energy at those bins So different approaches in finding those  coefficients can lead to quite different results Also I have the impression that interpolating the amplitude spectrum is just plain wrong Looking at the figure it seems obvious that the interpolation made me lose a lot of energy content in the range near  Hz For disclosure I did check each related question suggested by Stack Overflow as I wrote mine The most similar question to mine seems to be How to combine bins of my DFT however I believe I have several additional doubtsto start with Im eager for criticism on whether I am doing the right approach in taking the absolute value of the Fourier coefficients and then trying to reduce the number of bins or whether I should zeropad my signal to a number of observations that is a multiple of  and thus hopefully avoid leakage I dont know Im really struggling to understand the subject and I might be working with several misconceptions here any corrections will be appreaciated   PS I made a mistake in my assumptions I incorrectly assumed Matlabs interp function interpolates over a set of query points and averages the values inbetween What it is in fact doing is downsampling  PPS heres the code for coefficient reduction qp    numelX       X  interpX qp

1182,electronics, Regarding the following circuit example I want to find the optimum current for saturation of Q By saturation I mean the safe one For simplicity I didnt bias the transistor and Im assuming beta is very very stable  I sweep Vb from zero to V and obtain the following plots  leftclick to enlarge the plots Green plot is the power for the Q with respect to Vb  So by using a cursor I find the minimum pointafter cutoff for the BJT power This is where the saturation regime begins At this point Ic is maximum and I find Ib is around uA So if this transistor needs to be in ON OFF mode for long time does it make sense that I set Ib as uA to obtain the optimum saturation Or should I do some overshooting as common practice Im wondering how would it be safe set in common practice

1188,electronics, There seem to be two main classes of domestic battery chargers  intelligent chargers which charge batteries individually until some measurements of the batteries determine that charging should cease and dumb chargers which charge all batteries at the same rate These terms are marketingspeak and have no real formal definition However is it possible to approximate the functionality of an intelligent charger simply by charging one battery at a time I am mostly interested in domestic batteries with NiMH chemistry

1241,electronics, Reading this answer I was surprised to hear that there are excellent kinds of coaxial cable with a propagation speed of c  the speed of light The bargain basement number is about c and coaxial cable with a faster propagation velocity would have to have a lower dielectric constant Assuming vc scales as sqrtmur epsilonr as it would in free space that would mean the cable would have a relative dielectric constant of  for example Does this exist as a standard product If so are there applications where having excellent cable with such a high propagation velocity would be important Or would it be a sideeffect of other desirable properties of the dielectric

1411,english, Please note that this question does not appear to have been answered in the commonly referenced thread on serial commas This particular question relates to whether to allow a comma in a twoitem series when the first item contains and requires a coordinating conjunction  Here are the details Would you allow the final comma in this sentence The event enables staff international counterparts members of the public and others to discuss issues related to curriculum enrichment and conversion and teacher training My gut says yes but I dont like punctuating according to gut Basically what I see are two items in a series at the end which would not normally be separated by a comma eg we are having steak and carrots but the first item contains a compound joined by a coordinating conjunction so the author has chosen to use a comma before the final item to avoid grouping it with the first Thoughts Thanks

1413,english, I saw the word “sine qua non” in the article of New York Times October  written by Gail Collins under the title “The Gift of Glib”  The article deals with the big Republican debate held in New Hampshire this week and the word appears in the following sentence   is the sine qua non of the Herman Cain candidacy It would scrap the tax code and give us  percent corporate income and national sales taxes He mentions it every  seconds in the debate  I was able to find the definition of “sine qua non” in MerriamWebster Dictionary as “something absolutely indispensable or essential” and “Reliability is a sine qua non for success” as a sample of its usage I’m interested in how popular or common this word is among native English speakers I’ve been warned in howtowrite books that abuse of Latin often gives a pedantic tinge and looks odd  If I use “sine qua non” instead of essential or basic requirement in colloquial conversation with native speakers or even in writing will I be ridiculed

1466,ethereum, I am using Metamask for key storage in my dapp My understanding is that the Metamask app injects a web object and handles all the signing functions where needed by itself But Metamask currently provides support for chrome and firefox only to my knowledge and firefox plugin has some problems still I get weird errors and plugin hangs up sometimes I am not sure if there is android support either yet So I want there to be alternative option to use either metamask or sign everything by asking user for key I dont know how to the latter and if its possible to do both in same app

1506,ethereum, Truebit is a recent proposal for building smart contracts on top of Ethereum  Truebit allows outsourcing complex computations to untrusted parties verifying that the computation was done correctly and paying them for their work  The enforcement and incentives are implemented as a set of Ethereum smart contracts  This is an improvement over current Ethereum as currently the gas limit means that Ethereum smart contracts can only perform a limited amount  of computation There are various proposals for sharding which allow the Ethereum blockchain to scale to a larger number of transactions  They might plausibly allow for increasing the gas limit  So they could be viewed as an alternative to Truebit What advantages and disadvantages does Truebit have over sharding as a way of allowing smart contracts to perform more computation

1513,gamedev, As we all know the inclusion of LGBT characters has been a mighty controversial topic in recent film and literature Beauty and the Beast probably being the premier example Some love it with every fiber of their being while others absolutely detest the very thought of it Now keep in mind that I am not here to start a political firestorm nor am I here to preach my own personal beliefs regarding this Im simply asking the question will the inclusion of LGBT characters decrease potential sales In our game a pseudos JRPG one of our main story writers added two consuls of a civilization with heavy Roman influence but with different laws both female married Originally hailing from an area in which LGBT relationships are looked down upon I was quick to note that it may be too much controversy but it truly depends on where you live—for him it was almost completely normal As I see it we have three choices  We can keep the characters just as they are We can keep the characters but only imply their relationship We can alter the relationship entirely changing one to a male  Right now our main goal is to satisfy the general public while still strongly appealing to those who actually played JRPGs such as Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy back in the day Which of these three options should we choose to best enhance our sales or if its not up there what is the wisest way to go about doing this I am looking for facts and data if possible andor applicable EDIT Our target audience is Everyone Like we said we’re aiming to satisfy the general public while still appealing to those who played JRPG’s back in the ‘s  EDIT II Wow Every almost answer here contained a wealth of information and Id like to formally thank all that contributed I will be using the information from just about all of these answers and Im sure may others facing this issue may as well EDIT III If you have comments that aren’t answers or you’d like to further discuss this please refer to the official chat room as opposed to commenting Thanks  
1514,gamedev, Im having a hard time implementing the player moving around my world of x tiles that is generated using a noise function Im in it for weeks and I can not I mess around with the coordinates and theres always a bug I was trying like this   I paint the map around the player Im using a tilemap I paint a x area with the player positioned in the center    create a rectangle and center it in the player the rectangle has an equivalent size of x and each frame creates another rectangle that is compared with the old one so I take the area that has not yet been painted so I can paint  The problem is that when I reach the extremes of the map when x   or x   for example I need that x equals  and equals  respectively as if the world had turned and Im not sure how to deal with the worlds data and the coordinates of the tilemap because when I start by painting the map around the player it will be in a position that would be  and the rectangle  I can not understand what I have to do it I mess up everything with the coordinates in this question it helped me Im using the mod Make a d top down game with round map it works but what I am not able to do is pass the x and y correct there are always bugs of this type where I struggle with the numbers but no use if I fix the floor to one side the bug appears on the other  here was to be water and it has a land line for example Im using Godot   Up   Im not sure but it seems everything is going very well what I was wrong was forgetting that for example a x array starts from  to  I was really dumb The image below shows what it would look like in a x world  As I solved it was just doing this mapsize   and decreasing and adding values ??to the left or right   respectively since the rectangle starts at position   but when I do this now there is another problem when this happens  which occurs because of the mapsize   but without it it is still more messy   Up    I was able to fix the up  error I was calling the wrong mod function without adding the  x and  y so it arrived at  and it is no more than the verification mapsize   now it is working in the horizontal and vertical movements however Im still wrong to move diagonally  or   Up   I think I got it the problem if I was not mistaken was in the stairs so it works  LEFTUP   RIGHTUP   DOWNLEFT   DOWNRIGHT  But I still have to hit the pieces of map that are behind but I think its in the turn them off function I confess that I do not quite understand why this works I would like to understand Note  Still the rare cases that the map generates wrong but actually abusing the keys quickly clicking for all meaningless directions such as varying up and down pressing low a very strange movement but the failure happens 
1515,gamedev, I have a D world with some model in it the XZplane grid some gray boxes and a red box In the upperleft corner Im trying to draw a minimap that should represents the whole world in D flat As you can see I already achieved to draw the grid and the boxes just using their scaled position With the same logic I drew the camera too so heres my question how can I draw the cone of view for this camera In the image below I just drew a green shape that should explain what I mean better than words obviously the green one in the image doesnt represent the actual view for this camera its just an example  Im using LibGDX with a PerspectiveCamera so I got access to all the camera information like the fow the frustum and so on Any idea how to implement this

1518,gamedev,  This question already has an answer here   Convert quaternion to a different coordinate system                       answer                     Working in DirectX with DirectXMath objects If I have the rotation of an object relative to some coordinate space as quaternion Q and I have a transformation matrix tx from that coordinate space to world space how do I find the rotation of my object in world space My thinking which has proven inaccurate was Use XMMatrixDecompose on tx to get the orientation that is the rotation difference between world space and my local coordinate space qLocalToWorld invert it to get the rotation of the local coordinate system relative to the world qWorldToLocal and combine it with my local rotation Q XMVECTOR scale qLocalToWorld translation XMMatrixDecomposescale qLocalToWorld translation tx auto qWorldToLocal  XMQuaternionInverseqLocalToWorld auto worldOrientation  q  qWorldToLocal  I figured for eg that if the local coordinate system was rotated  degrees with respect to the world and my object was  degrees with respect to local this would yield the      in world space But I was wrong   Id appreciate help in understanding the right way to do this Thanks in advance

1526,gamedev, I noticed that I could not find any game that has a native bit version on the x platform there are some for platforms obviously for example the Nintendo  In fact when I asked if the Allegro library supported bit the developers had no idea When I tried to compile something for bit my compiler failed it was MingW it wrote that bit is not implemented This this make me wonder why At least if the issue was bitonly machines you could make two exes and run the more appropriate one or something But I havent even seen that so why does nobody make bit games

1528,gamedev, I am currently working on an ARPG and I am trying to figure out which elements of the game influence each other and one example is that endgame activities inherently influence loot dropshandling and the other way round The more classical loot systems we usually get in touch with are following  Classic MMORPG loot where enemy bodies have to be clicked which open up a window which displays the loot that can be clicked one item at a time Sometimes it is possible to enable autoloot in order to skip the clicking of each item ARPG loot where slain enemies die in a explosion of loot which can occasionally get extreme up to a point where loot filters are necessary otherwise the screen will be cluttered In this case players usually pick up uncapped currency like gold automatically while everything else from gear to crafting parts has to be looted manually if the player so desires Diablo Path of Exile and the likes to handle it with cliackable labels onscreen while Borderlands for example spreads the loot all around the place and has visual light beams indicating rarities that allows players to filter quickly and go grab the items they might be interested in Loot chests is what I call the system of Destiny During a strike or adventure players do participate in combat and are not distracted by random loot on the ground which would require consideration as to whether picking it up is a good choice After the event has ended typically after defeating the final boss a chest appears that contains loot Vacuum loot which was used for Guild Wars  and Wildstar where the loot physically drops on the ground and players can loot everything from currencies to gear with one click of a button In an ARPG this would never work out since inventory space is even more restricted than anything else  My naive first thoughts are based on how the endgame of Diablo  is designed In classic endgame rifts players can slay enemies and are usually busy picking up materials and some useless items that may be used to disassemble them for even more materials Furthermore they are looking for chests and hoping for some random drops In contrast to that game mode there are greater rifts which similiar to Destiny drop no loot at all except when you kill the final boss that appears after progressing far enough In greater rifts there are no distractions just the challenge to finish those at higher difficulties and farming them with specific speed builds while on the other hand the classic rift slow down gameplay when you have to stop every few meters just to click and pick up those items I have reached an impasse since I understand players might want to blaze through content and I dont want to make them slow down constantly with a system like classic rifts in Diablo or Path of Exile in general but when I stick to loot chests at the end of an activity it might happen that less loot drops in general and that there is less gratification when collecting things since the is nothing on the way Take a long dungeon for example a loot chest system might incentivize just skipping all enemies and do the bare minimum to tackle the final boss In such a scenario I basically invalidated almost the entire content I am presenting Comparing this to current legendary items in WoW if one legendary drops I might be relieved to finally get one and be angry about it since its a shitty one but I missed the reward stimulus up to the drop itself Applied to my scenario the player sees a dungeon as an annoying chore to finally get the chance of acquiring something If the drops are not satisfying it could possibly be more demotivating thinking that that only chance to get something after such a chore was a waste of time So my question is the following Even though loot explosions may be enojoyable at first they can degenerate into an annoyance eg clicking a bazillion items on the floor When thinking about making them less boring I end up with something that can be as frustrating in the end How can I balance this 
1529,gamedev, I am trying to make a spin wheel that is divided to  sections Each section is marked with a gameObject that is centered in that section After the player spins the wheel it will rotate until it starts to slow Then the wheel moves and stops in the center based on the section that was randomly selected I used the following code to rotate the wheel towards the  on the xaxis This code works fine and the wheel rotates fine but only if the selected section is over  on the xaxis float rotateFloat  randomReward        transformrotationz Quaternion targetRotation  QuaternionEulernew Vector  rotateFloat transformrotation  QuaternionRotateTowardstransformrotation targetRotation fdifX  TimedeltaTime  I did some digging and found that QuaternionRotateTowards finds the closest way towards the target and rotates using that direction This caused a problem with the direction of rotation Example see image The player swipes to spin randomReward is set to  on the spin wheel and the wheel starts rotating when the wheel slows down it starts moving towards the center Then it will stop spinning along the direction of the swipe and will rotate towards the other side Because the distance to the center is closer from the left side How can I set it to follow the same direction of the swipe regardless of which is closer to the center And if there is a better way to do this please enlighten me Thanks 
1530,gamedev, In games where you have to use an account to sign in or otherwise authenticate yourself eg MMO games it is often prohibited to share your account with other people For example in the World of Warcraft Official Terms of Use Agreement   You may not share the Account with anyone except that if you are a parent or guardian you may permit one  minor child to use the Account when not in use by you You are liable for all uses of the Account that has been enabled by you …  And the League of Legends Terms of Use   You can’t share your account or Login Credentials with anyone You can’t sell transfer or allow any other person to access your account or Login Credentials or offer to do so You’re entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login Credentials   What is the reason for this Is it because of legal reasons and  or security reasons I imagine account sharing would not be a problem if there werent some realworld consequences for the company not just the enduser

1536,gamedev, I thought using the standard assets aeroplane is the fastest way to get a stable airplane AI for my game but I guess I was wrong every thing works perfectly as long as there is only one aeroplane controller in the scene but if there is two one of them always dysfunctions and goes down when they reach their target My question is how can I fix it and is it worth the time in the end is this a game intended asset or just a sample I know that the AI script is calling functions from the Controller script but it gets the controller from GetComponent so that doesnt make sense 
1537,gamedev, There are some games where you need to make special movement with your mouse spell casting or any other action  Something like this  So basically how can I compare mouse movement to my pattern lets say defined by series of points x y I assume theres no need to track the position every frame there must be an interval But in terms of technique how can I do it 
1538,gamedev, This is borderline nongamedev but PIDs are commonly used in games so I thought Id give it a shot Ive got a few PID controllers in my game used for things like steering and throttle control Im having trouble tuning them accurately  It never feels like Im getting closer to the optimial solution and its very tempting to just leave them good enough with the odd oscillation or spike I cant get rid of The one controller thats driven me to this post with frustration produces minor oscillations for very very small error inputs  At large inputs its ok but not very stable Does anyone have any tips or resources on how I can train these things more reliably 
1539,gamedev, The Logic The player which is a cube  by  pixels checks if their is a cell next to it that has the name Wall This is done using a tileset To do this collision check I made four checks in this order  Is their a wall under the player Is their a wall to the left of the player Is their a wall to the right of the player Is their a wall above the player  If the player for example touches the wall to the left of him The x coordinates of the player are set to the tile right of the wallcell that was collided with The Problem If for example I move the player left the loop will first check for a collision under the player however this makes the player move up if their is a wall to the left of the player which he is touching Note it doesnt always do this only if the player moved enough pixels to the left The player should have just stopped moving to the left Moving up was not desired Experiments I tried adding the left and right check for collision first This way the bottom check should not see the cell This made the player teleport to the left and right of the cell the player was currently on because gravity has time now to drag the player down enough pixels The player is always affected by gravity and I rather not change this for it wouldnt make sense for an entity like the player to not be affected by it Making the movement speed of the player smaller This did have an affect which was more desired but the players movement speed should not be effected at all as a fix The Code Collision detection code      Floor collision     if mapisWallxCoordinates yCoordinates    mapisWallxCoordinates   yCoordinates           yCoordinates  intyCoordinates             Left collision     if mapisWallxCoordinates   yCoordinates  mapisWallxCoordinates   yCoordinates            xCoordinates  intxCoordinates                 canMoveLeft  false      else         canMoveLeft  true       Right collision     if mapisWallxCoordinates   yCoordinates  mapisWallxCoordinates   yCoordinates            xCoordinates  intxCoordinates             canMoveRight  false      else         canMoveRight  true       Roof collision     if mapisWallxCoordinates yCoordinates    mapisWallxCoordinates   yCoordinates            canGoUp  false       The isWall function public Cell getCellByPixelfloat cellPositionX float cellPositionY         if cellPositionX    cellPositionY           if tileidgetCellintcellPositionX   intcellPositionY    null             return tileidgetCellintcellPositionX   intcellPositionY         return null   private TiledMapTile getTileByPixelfloat cellPositionX float cellPositionY      if getCellByPixelcellPositionX cellPositionY  null         if getCellByPixelcellPositionX cellPositionYgetTile  null             return getCellByPixelcellPositionX cellPositionYgetTile      return null    Check if the cell has a tile with the property of Wall We can see this in the tsx file public boolean isWallfloat cellPositionX float cellPositionY      if getTileByPixelcellPositionX cellPositionY  null         if getTileByPixelcellPositionX cellPositionYgetPropertiesgetWall  null             return true      return false   Player movement private void Movement      if canMoveLeft         if GdxinputisKeyPressedKeysA  GdxinputisKeyPressedKeysLEFT             xCoordinates  playerMovementSpeed  GdxgraphicsgetDeltaTime      if canMoveRight         if GdxinputisKeyPressedKeysD  GdxinputisKeyPressedKeysRIGHT             xCoordinates  playerMovementSpeed  GdxgraphicsgetDeltaTime

1542,gamedev, I am trying to make a D RPG game in Unity with an isometric tile setup Using UnityC how do I code the characters upward right left down and diagonal animations and movements using mouse button as the controls much like Red Alert  Normally this can easily be done using keyboard inputs however what I am trying to do is control the character by clicking the mouse For example if I click in a diagonal location from the character the character should follow the mouse and also do the diagonal animation

1546,gamedev, Im trying to use the Android camera in LibGDX I tried using this implementation of the API which is basically the only you will find on Google  httpsgithubcomlibgdxlibgdxwikiIntegratinglibgdxandthedevicecamera However most of it is deprecated It uses GL and the methods it calls to connect to the camera are stubs It is not usable and the API has probably got easier to use since but Id rather not look at google documentation when this has probably been made before or has it nothing on Google anyway So do I have to make my own implementation or is there anything available that would make it any easier Or is the  implementation actually still usable somehow Thanks in advance

1552,gamedev, In the game there is a forest and animals living in it The interaction of the animals is just a background ambiance When googling I found GoalOriented Action Planning pattern And this pattern seems to solve the issue If we give goals to the animals while achieving their goals they can behave realistically for the ambiance After more research I found a paper which is advising extending GOAP with smart ambiance objects to make agents behave context aware Feeling the Ambiance Using Smart Ambiance to Increase Contextual Awareness in Game Agents   For example think of an adventure game the player is searching for cluesitems in the forest  Meanwhile a bird nonplayer character is looking for a fruit on the tree to eat  Bird sees a fruit on the tree but also saws a snake danger close to the fruit So bird afraid and do not decide to eat that fruit  Are there other algorithmspatterns that you can remind to solve this need 
1553,gamedev, Im trying to write a generic turnbased strategy game with a few unit types building types etc Since this is something Ive never done before and its not a very easily searchable subject Im asking here See title question I thought of two ways to implement unitbuilding types The first is the most obvious with each unit being a complete object inandof itself This means that it would have all stats abilities etc contained in the object A factory method would create these objects when units are trained The main drawback is that each unit of the same type would also have duplicate information like movement points that are constant among all units of that type Of course in the event of stat upgrades these could be changed directly so they would no longer be duplicate The second method of doing this is storing basic unit info such as base health movement points etc in a UnitTypes class The unit object could then be done away with completely in favor of a list of unit types whose important stats are kept in UnitTypes Alternatively the unit object could hold unique info such as stat upgrades This seems better because its less data being used as well as making unit type upgrades simpler The unit would just change its type field to its previous type plus  But this might be much harder once I actually begin writing it and encountering issues I havent thought of yet Is there a standard practice It seems like one of those things where one approach is way better than the other in  of situations 
1554,gamedev, i have just installed bit of Windows  on my old i computer with gb of ram it installed well but when i load the licence file at the startup it suddenly exits and starts up an application named unity bug report does this mean it needs more than GB of ram even for android development I have worked with cycles in blender which is a raytracing engine which needs more computer power than realtime engines like in unity is something wrong with the license file Ram or what I hope i cleared everything please help  Thanks in advance Edit The version of unity is  I manualy uploaded the license file using my phone by the instructions given on the screen  When i opend the license file ulf in notepad it looked like an html file so i tried opening it with chrome now i read Failed to begin license download we are sorry it looks like the license file has already been downloaded Maybe something worng with during the activation process  Looks like the error page was saved as ulf file so i restarted the manual activation but all the times same things happens it is killing me  
1555,gamedev, Is there such a thing as a short answer on how to do a Mode   mario kart type effect in pygame I have googled extensively all the docs I can come up with are dozens of pages in other languages asm c with lots of strangelooking equations and such Ideally I would like to find something explained more in English than in mathematical terms I can use PIL or pygame to manipulate the imagetexture or whatever else is necessary I would really like to achieve a mode  effect in pygame but I seem close to my wits end Help would be greatly appreciated Any and all resources or explanations you can provide would be fantastic even if theyre not as simple as Id like them to be If I can figure it out Ill write a definitive how to do mode  for newbies page edit mode  doc httpwwwcoranaccomtonctextmodehtm 
1556,gamedev, So since I’ve been working a lot with LWJGL recently I’ve come to learn that Android has native OpenGL support So what does this mean for me Is OpenGL handled the same way it is in LWJGL What’re the larger differences between the two 
1557,gamedev, This particular query adheres to mechanics of unreal engine  which uses PhysX as its physics engine but is generally applicable to all engines that have an indpendent physics engine So the question is how to make a walkable physics object while maintaining non realistic physics character mechanics As we know in nearly all cases for a humanoid player use a logic that is not simulated rigid body physics but uses very specialised movement code which mimics the physics but does not follows the free body physics of rest of the rigid bodies  An example of this is PhysXs character controller The side effect of this is the character becomes a nonsimulated infinite mass body to other physics objects and so if you walk onto one the physics system would throw the simulated platform away using a large velocity How should I go about to keep realistic rigid body physics offered by physics engine along while still keeping the characters movement behaviour without problems Say for example a habitable space ship or a walkable asteroid that does not goes crazy as soon as touches the player

1559,gamedev, Im trying to start the latest version of magicavoxel under windows  bits but after unziping all the file in a folder when I double click on the MagicaVoxelexe file I get nothing I tried to run it through command line in case there was an error but nothing is show I can see Magicavoxelexe in the task manager for about  seconds and the it go away I have a i cpu and a geforce gt  maybe not the best gears but it should be able to run it Any idea on why magicavoxel is closing after starting up or at least a way to get an error message 
1562,gamedev, In a game Im toying with in Godot engine I have angles given in degrees in some places and angles given in radians in other places Sometimes I need to mix both angles ie add them What builtin function allows me to convert degrees to radians and the other way around Or is there none PS I realize that converting those is not rocket science and I could code something on my own but Godot is already doing such conversions internally so I would venture a guess that such function already exists

1564,gamedev, I have used the scripting root motion move the player when using an inplace animation   All works correctly until the players rotation is off  This is expected as the movement is along the transformz axis but how can I account for the rotation in the script and apply it so the movement is correct in game The gorillacontroller script is the script we are trying to fix On playerGorilla animator is on the playergorilla The gorilla is the gameobject holding the mesh and the bones for the character   I will also add the transforms are moving this was my silly mistake because I had tool handles in global instead of local   This makes it even more confusing however because all tranformz blue axis are facing the correct way for the animation to work but the animation is only ever playing in the original direction where the rotation is  using UnityEngine using SystemCollections  RequireComponenttypeofAnimator  public class RootMotionScript  MonoBehaviour       void OnAnimatorMove                Animator animator  GetComponentAnimator             if animator                           Vector newPosition  transformposition                newPositionz  animatorGetFloatRunspeed  TimedeltaTime                 transformposition  newPosition

1567,gamedev, Im trying to write code to transfer animations that were designed for one skeleton to look correct on another skeleton The source animations consist only of rotations except for translations on the root theyre the mocap animations from the CMU motion capture database Many D applications eg Maya have this facility builtin but Im trying to write a very simple version of it for my game Ive done some work on bone mapping and because the skeletons are hierarchically similar bipeds I can do  bone mapping for everything but the spine can work on that later The problem however is that the base skeletonbind poses are different and the bones are different scales shorterlonger so if I just copy the rotation straight over it looks very strange Ive attempted a number of things similar to lorancous solution below to no avail ie multiplying each frame in the animation by a bonespecific multiplier If anyone has any resources on stuff like this papers source code etc that would be really helpful

1573,gamedev, So after taking some time running through a course I believe I have enough experience with referring back to the course how to make the game I wish to all apart from one thing How to draw the game on screen I know how the game would work behind the screen but dont know how to draw it Im looking for an experienced informed answer based upon certain factors To provide some context the game in questions interface would be very simple  Grid of lines  Control each cells content text and colour Pan and zoom  The game at the minute is based upon an excel spreadsheet as shown to show how simple it is  My aim to keep this question open to others is to create a pros and cons of each Ive narrowed down possibilities to this list These are taken from the apple developer page under the section Graphics and Games  Core Animation  Core Graphics  GLKit Metal OpenGL ES cocoas d Other Noteworthy  Im asking for an informed opinion as to which I should choose This is narrowed down from research however I assume I will have missed things that may make this task much easier My problem thus far is that most games assumed I needed sprites but in something this simple Im assuming I dont If it makes any difference my current knowledge is only swift high school math and hopeful abundance of learning resources Ive been stuck with this problem for a long time and I would be overjoyed if I could get some experienced advice Thanks

1578,gamedev, I have a game engine which handles hexagon based war games and things like LOS etc for both flat and tip up hexes  A particular game Im implementing at the moment Band of Brothers has facing for vehicles and optionally for infantry Ive searched the web and have not found any algorithms to handle determining the hexagons that fall within an arc expanding out from a hexagon  Here are some pictures to describe what Im talking about   I represent the hexagon locations as offset coordinates and have the values for all of the dimensions of each hexagon and the endpoints of the vertices and center in relation to the overall map stored as doubles  I also convert to cube coordinates for determining distance Just looking for ideas or pointers on how I might determine these hexagons   EDIT I do not have a rep   so I cant add a picture of offset coordinates  There is a good one here on gamedev though  Heres an ASCII art representation of it  The numbers will be a little different depending on which row is indented etc                                         
1579,gamedev,  I have a LineRenderer that ignores certain Layers based on a Raycast using LayerMask I have a cube with a collider on a Layer which is ignored because of the LayerMask I have a smaller object inside the cube that is a child object of the cube and is on a layer that is not set to be ignored I need the Raycast to hit the smaller object  When this smaller object is unparented from the larger cube the LineRenderer behaves like I want it to the hit data informs me it is being hit by the Raycast but this does not hold true if the smaller object is a child of the cube  Is there a way of having this behaviour without having to unparent the smaller object Its like the smaller object is inheriting the parents Layer despite being on its own Layer  does this sound like what is happening

1583,gamedev, Im writing with Javascript and canvas API but my question could be general and not related to any specific technology I have some object convex shapes and I like to find some combination of them stacked one stacked above the others in a perfect equilibrium Ive found a lot physics engine implementations but they ask me to manually position elements and then they are calculating forces I need the way round I need to know how to position elements in the space so that the forces are in equilibrium Im thinking on some brute force method but not going very far till now Any hint is very appreciated

1585,gamedev, I have a d square grid used for pathfinding that I wish to convert into a navigation mesh  My idea is to pluck out all of the nodes that are on the edge of walkable space simplify the amount of data with a line reduction algorithm then triangulate the set of points  I am stuck at the simplifying step To find edge nodes I use a marching squares algorithm  The downside to using marching squares is that the points are unsorted and in order to pass the points into the RamerDouglasPeucker algorithm they need to be sorted by connectivity and separated into individual lines  Im looking for an algorithm that can either sort my collection by connectivity or discover edge nodes in a consecutive manner Im trying out Djikstra search to find a path from one point to the next  To determine if these points are connected during path reconstruction if the parent point has a Euclidean distance greater than  to the current point then they are not directly connected  I might be able to get this to work but it is proving to be extremely slow Here are screenshots of the graph I am working with d pathfinding grid  unsorted edge nodes discovered via marching squares  
1586,gamedev,  This question already has an answer here   LWJGL—How to Animate and Render Characters Using a Sprite Sheet                       answer                     Im talking here about walking animations and such for a bit RPG I have a simple sprite sheet that contains walking animations for all directions up left down and right but Im having trouble getting LWJGL to animate them—how would I do it 
1587,gamedev, Im trying to display x pixel art textures all textures have x but they are not displayed how I expected they are kind of blurry I have seen this question before question but this was not answering my question My approach I use the resize from this url webglfundamentals Which means my canvas has the following properties   widthvw heightvh  Then I set my viewport to  glviewportglcanvaswidth glcanvasheight  For the sprite rendering I use a orthographic camera  function orthoout  glcanvaswidth  glcanvasheight   from glmatrix  The sprite Iam trying to display consists of this vertices   new FloatArray             which means it is very small so I scaled them up I understand that my original texture has only the size x and when I scale it up it gets stretched So my question is how would you setup the viewport and why Also an explanation would be nice since I have the feeling I did not quite understand the connection between viewport orthographic camera and width and height of the canvas

1590,gamedev, So after taking some time running through a course I believe I have enough experience with referring back to the course how to make the game I wish to all apart from one thing How to draw the game on screen I know how the game would work behind the screen but dont know how to draw it Im looking for an experienced informed answer based upon certain factors To provide some context the game in questions interface would be very simple  Grid of lines  Control each cells content text and colour Pan and zoom  The game at the minute is based upon an excel spreadsheet as shown to show how simple it is  My aim to keep this question open to others is to create a pros and cons of each Ive narrowed down possibilities to this list These are taken from the apple developer page under the section Graphics and Games  Core Animation  Core Graphics  GLKit Metal OpenGL ES cocoas d Other Noteworthy  Im asking for an informed opinion as to which I should choose This is narrowed down from research however I assume I will have missed things that may make this task much easier My problem thus far is that most games assumed I needed sprites but in something this simple Im assuming I dont If it makes any difference my current knowledge is only swift high school math and hopeful abundance of learning resources Ive been stuck with this problem for a long time and I would be overjoyed if I could get some experienced advice Thanks

1592,gamedev, I have a Qt  app that on Windows many of the geometries Im drawing flickers  My problem description is vague because Im at a complete loss Does anyone know if theres an issue with flickering on Windows with OpenGL I think Qt uses ANGLE for OpenGL that would be different than in Linux  My app on Linux seems to work perfectly Specifically my app draws LIDAR ground points GLPOINTS and boxes around objects GLLINES and range marker circles GLLINELOOP  These are all drawn to the same context  I also set up double buffering  All the rendering takes place on a render thread  This is done in the style of Scene Graph  Rendering FBOs in a thread so no QtD When the app starts initially it seems fine but after a couple seconds different geometries say the boxes around objects andor the range marker circles start flickering  Although theyre all on the same context all of the same geometries say the range markers will flicker at the same rate independent of the other geometry types or all the boxes While this is happening my measured FPS does slow down but the flickering still occurs even when the FPS is up at   Ive even inserted some glFlushes and glFinishes  no impact either on FPS or flickering UPDATE I must have made a mistake when testing glFinish or something changed because now glFinish removes the flicking and kills my FPS The structure of my renderers is that I have one class that sets up the viewports calls glClear and then invokes render on each renderer  Those renderers have a buffer setup with vertex array buffers I set some uniforms and call glDrawArrays  I dont think Im doing anything unconventional eg openglsafetybufferbind  glEnableGLBLEND glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA  QOpenGLVertexArrayObjectBinder vaoBindersafetyvao rendersafetyprogrambind  glLineWidthsafetyrangesconfiglineWidthvalueGLfloat rendersafetyprogramsetUniformValuecol vcol  glUniformMatrixfvrendersafetyprogramuniformLocationmvp staticcastGLsizeimvpmatricessize GLTRUE reinterpretcastGLfloatmvpmatrices glDrawArraysGLLINELOOP  openglsafetybufferCountVertices  glDisableGLBLEND  rendersafetyprogramrelease openglsafetybufferrelease  My vertex and fragment shaders are very simple I dont have great profiling data right now but the little I do have shows that all my renderers combined dont take even half of the s time per frame I need The flickering started when I moved away from using a Scene Graph Under QML mixed with QtD towards the threaded FBO example  so I figure theres nothing intrisic in my geometries that should be causing the flickering UPDATE Posting my top level render code  Basically I have a loop that calls all my individual renderers sequentially all on the same thread and on the same context Top level render code    renderfbobind   Clear contextfunctionsglClearColorf f f f contextfunctionsglClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT   Render only the faces closest to you contextfunctionsglEnableGLDEPTHTEST contextfunctionsglDepthMaskGLTRUE        Configure out viewport xy width height     unsigned int i       foreach const auto v scenegraphviewports               Make sure that the viewports cameras are updated         vcameracalculatePosition          auto vs  vpaddedRect         contextversionFunctionsQOpenGLFunctionsCoreglViewportIndexedfi vsx vsy vswidth vsheight         i        foreach const auto model scenegraphmodels      if modelisDirty              modelrenderersynchronizemodel         modeldataSynced          modelrendererrender    Reset OpenGL state contextfunctionsglDisableGLDEPTHTEST   We need to flush the contents to the FBO before posting  the texture to the other thread otherwise we might  get unexpected results contextfunctionsglFlush   FPS recalculateFPS  renderfbobindDefault renderfboswapdisplayfbo  emit textureReadydisplayfbotexture size  When I include glFlush glFinish after modelrendererrender I can see that some of my renders specially my GroundRenderer is taking waay too much time the black line represents the amx time for  frame  So my goal now is to figure out why GroundRenderer takes so much time  It basically just writes to a large circular buffer  Im not experienced enough yet though to know what large is but I havent really observed a sensitivity to the specific size of the buffer I cut its size by a few orders of magnitude and didnt see any real difference

1624,gaming, Edit I removed the somewhat silly parts that I originally included in the question for fun since it appears some people didnt appreciate it In the Elder Scrolls games I played previous to Skyrim there were only adults Now Skyrim has clearly shown that there are without any doubt children in the Elder Scrolls universe However we still dont see any infantstoddlers or any adolescents apart from young adults even worse there are no elvish orcish or beast argonian khajiit childrencubs that Im aware of Further adding to the mystery is the fact that we dont see any pregnant women While Im sure the reasons game design related and ethical considering the hardships that plague the inhabitants of Tamriel I wonder if there are any ingame mentions of younger children Also when you think about it we have a lot of different races in Tamriel and interracial couples arent uncommon However we never as far as I know see any evidence of mixedrace offspring This would suggest one of the following things  A couple of different races cannot produce offspring The race of the offspring is always the same as one of the parents Its easier for the developers to just have everything as one of the race presets practical answer Im looking for inuniverse answers or examples if possible  Now this could definitely become very speculative something Im sure we want to keep at a minimum So Im looking for official sources primarily ingame but devwriter statements are also interesting Im not looking for answers like its hard to program or having infants would mean complicated ethical issues if you could kill their only parent or maybe even them as I am very aware of these issues Are there any examples of there being small babies or toddlers in the Elder Scrolls universe Is there any mention or case of interracial couples having children Is there any mention of elvish orcish or beast race children

1626,gaming, So I just got the spell to Summon the shade of Arniel Gane However it seems very difficult to cast correctly It always seems that out of the heat of battle I can get it to work if I aim very carefully at a flat surface and look slightly towards the ground But in the heat of battle I can never get a successful cast It takes several tries to get him to summon where I point him The spell looks like it works but I dont see the blue vortex or him anywhere It seems to be related to how flat the surface is ie I can only get it to work on really flat surfaces Any hints here EDIT After some testing it appears he DOES summon but seemingly really far away and unrelated to where I was pointing I was aiming at the ground slightly in front of me and cast the spell After searching around he was trying to run to me from the right but got stuck behind some rocks Does anyone else have this issue

1780,graphicdesign, I freelance but Im still green in some areas and Copyright is one of them I know about usingpurchasing stock and all that I have accounts on all the stock sites but I created a design which resulted in some issuesThe design had some copyrighted material and heres where Im confused  My design is complete vector based I either made my own vector from an image or I used a Photoshop brush I was once told that a loophole with using images was that if you make a brush out of an image and create that image using a brush its considered a tool and theres technically no copyright This could be wrong information or maybe it doesnt apply to certain imagery I downloaded a brush set that doesnt have any copyright restrictions attached to it and used that to create some of my images that are an issue So my question is if I create my own vector or use a brush of an image lets say Mickey Mouse could that still create copyright issues     My next question is fonts Can words be copyrighted Some of the issues in my design were words and I understand the issue was probably related to the LOOK of the words but if I find a font one free font I found looked similar can I use this without any issue Any help would be appreciated I havent had to worry about copyright before until this project and it confuses me so much

1867,graphicdesign, In one of my Photoshop projects the client wanted to see some different variations of a specific area so I needed to be able to select the exact same area every time To do this I created a layer I call Selection Mask which is just filled with a colour outside the palette of the image I set this layer as the topmost layer and then draw a rectangle over the area I always wanted to copy I then use the Magic Wand to select the block in this layer then hide it so that I can see everything beneath it I then CTRL  SHIFT  C Copy Merged to copy the visible content and paste it in MSPaint with the other samples Is there a more effective way of doing this I want to be able to close and reopen the image later on and reselect the exact same area partially for OCD reasons and partially because when I am done I want the client to be able to put all the png images in a folder and leftright arrow through them and not have a layout change I numbered each version so they can tell me what number they like best and I can build a better version of it For what its worth the client is a user within the company we dont have a graphic designer so being one of the IT personnel somewhat acclimated with Photoshop and Illustrator I usually get logo requests who does not have Photoshop or any software that allows layered images really

1896,health, Is my hobby source of my anxieties  I have always been very big into fishing but since I moved to Australia it has definitely been a game changer The fact that you can do big game fishing at your doorstep and chase marlins tunas and various very large species of fish is amazing But it all comes down to a cost and I have been wondering if my mental health has taken a toll Fishing is meant to be a relaxing hobby but what happens if its turned into an unhealthy addiction  As a child I have always been the stressed one anxious over the tiniest things  and once they are past  gone I realised it wasnt that horrible and I worked myself up for no reason Unfortunately I do think most of my anxieties and my stress and the fact that I feel that I am trapped at work or in life comes from Fishing  Spear Fishing or just in general the chase of the bigger better fish Chasing big fish requires to understand the environment they evolve in at what time and understand which variables come to play to make the mission a success Having social media helps because you can see reports from other people  but at the same time it is bad because it gives me the worst fear of missing out and I struggle to cope with the fact that someone has caught the big fish I wanted to catch when I was stuck at work and I should have probably just called in sick and try If I did do that and the mission failed then I would have  called in sick for no reason two would hate going back to work the next day because I know I could also give it another shot This is why I can safely say that in the making of websites as part of my job I probably spend ¾ of that time thinking about where I could be and what I could be achieving and gives me that feeling of being trapped forced to do something I do not want to do One major problem with fishing is its endless You can always catch better and bigger and you can spend h in the ocean and still not have caught what you have wanted Someone on social media might catch a bigger one  at the same spot in the ocean h after you have left and gives you the worst feeling of insatisfaction Its always a happy moment catching the fish you have been targeting But after that what happens  Your only memory would be a photo you share with people  maybe to make them jealous if they are into the same thing as you   Hey have a look I caught bigger than you did last week  I therefore must be better than you  And the cycle kicks in again Its expensiveness has never been a problem for me I believe you have to do what you have to do and just a car needs fuel to run you need fishing gear to fish I always find that the time spent fishing should be great for the mind and a happy free moment but am I just escaping from reality and making it worse  I feel like the ultimate aim is just show off in front of other fishermen I find that never getting satisfied AND always wanting to do it again at the price of anything is wrong I think they are two things that when combined do not go together  You cannot get away from it every day every hour looking at the wind tides currents water temperature who went where when how fills my head with constant thoughts that are very far away from the reality and could have an effect on the direct things you need to focus on in life health family  relationships I know this sounds exaggerated and it’s not and I am sure a few people could relate to that When you could go away with your partner for a holidays and you realise you second guessed yourself thinking … What if the fish are going to turn up in front of Sydney and I cannot target them what if I miss out  Maybe I shouldnt be going away  Maybe this also comes down to impatience always wanting to achieve right now not thinking I ultimately have my whole time to be catching that fish And it’s not like we don’t know what we are doing we have been there and done that we already have achieved it but it’s just never enough I hate myself for the state of mind it puts me in sometimes a prime example would be that week where very large fish could be spearfished off the rocks and I couldn’t go because the weather was just no good  and I just hated that situation so much that I was very cold to my partner the whole weekend and then hated the week of work And I know I can give her the silent treatment sometimes Am I just an eternal unsatisfied  I have wanted to pick up surfing recently and have been getting lessons I obviously love the ocean and what it offers and I did find it very relaxing but I found I got hard on myself and I already started to want to be better  faster And I am worry the relaxation surf can bring to me would turn into an obsession of wanting to surf bigger and all the time So what is the point  Can you hate something you love that much  Do I just love it or do I just do it because I have been doing it for so long now it’ll be weird not seeing myself holding big fish  Is it that bad that it’ll come first wherever I go whatever I do  whichever situation I find myself into I’ll always be thinking about WHAT if I was fishing or damn it I cannot fish today … my day is over … I am just looking for a second opinion I know everyone is different and I know that people fishing the rivers are more relaxed because it’s not as precise time consuming and life doesn’t have to be on standby Maybe some of you could relate with different hobbies

1907,health, In the past couple of days Ive repeatedly heard and read that cinnamon consumption increases the metabolic rate in humans A Google search brings up plenty of results However few of them cite any concrete evidence In fact even those that mention sources point to circumstantial evidence at best For instance Livestrongcom states  A  study published in the International Journal of Preventative   Medicine investigated the effects of cinnamon in people with type    diabetes One group took cinnamon supplements every day while the   other group took a placebo After eight weeks the cinnamon group lost   more weight and body fat than the group taking the placebo even   though the cinnamon group did not make any changes to their usual   eating habits  Similarly all minuteathletecom put forth to back their claim is  If you’ve ever read the Hour Body by Tim Ferris and if you haven’t   I highly recommend it you probably remember the section on his   cinnamon experiments Basically he found that eating about one and a   half teaspoons of cinnamon a day can help regulate glucose levels   which in turn helps control weight gain  Idealbitecom goes into more detail about the purported effects of cinnamon on the body and mentions two studies but doesnt give links or any information with which to find either of them So basically my question is how much evidence is there really for the metabolismaccelerating effects of cinnamon intake and how conclusive is it

1919,health, I am not an orthodontist but a physicist But while discussing a certain orthodontic technique with an experienced boardcertified orthodontist who graduated and practice in the US it became apparent to me that the technique he was taught and uses is quite overoptimistic in its ignorance of the effects of elementary physical principles which is why it almost always results in a muchlessthanideal outcome and it also greatly disturbs and compromises the other satisfactory elements of the bite After thinking about the situation I came up with a quite simple alternative technique to fully control the desired movement without disturbing the satisfactory areas of the bite It might be implemented with existing orthodontic devices which I am familiar with however it may be enhanced and slightly simplified with a new auxiliary device that I have conceptually invented Not being a physician how do I publish this technique under my name How can I patent this auxiliary device when I did not actually built it but only drew a sketch Not that I try to become a millionaire I just want to prevent others from taking over this idea and charging orthodontistspatients for using it

1938,health, Contrary to the recent past when high carb  low fat diets were recommended it appears that now the opposite type diet is often being recommended  Many doctors who have written books on the subject recommend diets high in fat and extremely low in carbohydrates limiting them at  of caloric intake  It is unclear how pragmatically one could live on just  carbohydrate  The latter represents the most efficient source of energy for the body  Athletic performance endurance would suffer with only  carbohydrate    I gather the idea of the high fat diet is to change the metabolic state of the body in a state of ketosis whereby given the absence of readily available carbohydrate fuel the body learns how to use and burn fat for energy  Is this process all that healthy and sustainable over the long term  And would it enhance cognitive capabilities over the long term as one ages

1968,history, If there is anything in my mind that has been particularly pronounced about American historical interests it has been an overriding interest in the military aspects of history  This can be viewed in the curriculum of American schools where the conquests of the GrecoRomman empires and EuropeanAmerican wars are given a lions share of attention  In the history channel where before the channels devolving into a series of reality shows and alienbiblical nonsense was virtually monopolized by commentary and analysis of the civil war and world war II It can even be seen on this forum where many of the posts seem to focus on military history tactics and culture I think it is very important for America and given its power the rest of the world as well to determine if and if so why Americans have become so focused on the military aspects of history  Are there examples of other empires such as England the Netherlands Spain etc having similar cultural fixations on the military  Or is this a unique aspect of American culture  If this is a trend what in American history has lead to the development of our military veneration While I believe this question may stray from the forums QA format somewhat I do believe that it neither deviates too strongly from said format or is phrased in such a way that it is impossible to provide analysis of trends which can be backed up by solid research

1999,history, According to this guy  The Jewish rebellion in AD  that ignited the war with Rome was by no means inevitable Judaism was a legal religion in the Roman Empire and Neros own empress Poppaea was very interested in it Contrary to biblical novels and movies far worse things could happen to you in the ancient world than to be conquered by Rome The Romans hung out the traffic lights in their sprawling empire curbing piracy at sea and brigandage by land thus providing security in the Mediterranean world The apostle Pauls missionary journeys would have been impossible without the Pax Romana the Roman peace that ordered society As for the horrors of Roman taxation I would much rather have paid the tribute to Rome as a citizen of Jerusalem than American income tax  Hed rather pay Roman tax than pay American income tax I wonder how much Romans actually had to pay

2001,history, I have been trying to find an answer to the above question In preRoman and during Roman Britain were the Celtic peoples promiscuous or did they have only one married partner Is there strong enough evidence to point either way I found this so far  We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way   than do you Roman women” the Celtic lady retorted disdainfully   “for we consort openly with the best men whereas you   let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest”  Dio Cassius quoting the reply of a Celtic wife   to a jeering accusation of promiscuity from a Roman matron  However there are also atone carvings from Celtic culture that appear to show married couples Also see chapter  of  Cornelius Tacitus Germania  They live in a state of chastity well secured corrupted by no seducing shows and public diversions by no irritations from banqueting Of learning and of any secret intercourse by letters they are all equally ignorant men and women Amongst a people so numerous adultery is exceedingly rare a crime instantly punished For to a woman who has prostituted her person no pardon is ever granted However beautiful she be however young however abunding in wealth a husband she can never find  Which is it or both

2003,history, I am by no means an archaeologist I am  like many people  simply intrigued by the mysteries of ancient Egypt I am not a proponent of any of these crazy fringe theories and Im not looking for evidence of some outlandish alternative history I only want to know the facts there are still many unresolved questions around the Giza complex especially the Great Pyramid I do not expect anyone here to be able to answer those questions conclusively I am just trying to research as much as possible in order to be able to perhaps draw some conclusions of my own As such I need reliable information and it seems to be remarkably difficult to come by Why are there so few clear recordspictures of the interior of the pyramids Why is that whenever I try to look up the answer to a straight forward question I see nothing but newspaper articles and the silly theories of fringe archaeologists I am a physicist myself and am no stranger to the scientific method or research I have dabbled in a wide variety of subjects and rarely has it been so difficult to research the facts Given that Giza is one of the most widely known archaeological sites on Earth I would have expected it to be quite easy to find information It seems almost as if someone is deliberately trying to make it as difficult as possible Im not looking to validate a theory I have no horse in this race I am not a subscriber to the theory that the pyramids are  years old or whatever else If there is significant evidence that the Great Pyramid was a tomb for Khufu then so be it but where is this evidence Why are there no hieroglyphs or paintings or statues or carvings anywhere in the pyramids yet all other ancient Egyptian architecture is littered with it Why do the pyramids differ so greatly from all the other examples of Egyptian tombs such as those in the Valley of the Kings Why does the Great Pyramid contain chambers and corridors high above ground level Kings chamber Queens chamber and Grand Gallery but neither Khufus or Menkaures pyramids contain any elevated chambers Or could there be chambers we have yet to discover How do Egyptologists reconcile the idea that the Great Pyramid was a tomb for Khufu with the obvious and remarkable differences between the Kings chamber and other tombs built for other Pharoahs Why were both Khufus and Khafres coffers made of a bland unfinished block of granite with no decoration or artwork As opposed to other coffers found in the valley of the kinds which are intricately carved with patterns and decorations Are we supposed to believe that the two Pharoahs important enough to have these great pyramids erected for them could afford to have a decent coffer Surely this is nonsense These are just examples of the questions I have As I said Im not looking to validate a theory and I am prepared to accept answers of we dont know All I want is something to go off where is all this information Why does Egyptology seem so secretive Why must it be so difficult for an enthusiast to find reliable information on the subject

2007,history, After WW Marshall Aid was distributed across Europe to facilitate the rebuilding of countries devastated by the war West Germany received a large amount of this and soon had a thriving economy However the UK one of the victors of the war apparently received the single highest volume of aid but was quite obviously on its knees financially some bomb damage in London apparently not being repaired for decades Was postwar bankruptcy purely down to the outstanding debt incurred through AngloAmerican war time loans Finally if these outstanding debts owed to the US and Canada really were what crippled the UK financially why not just write off the debt and not bother with Marshall Aid at all to the UK

2022,history, This answer to this question states Latin was the language of diplomacy in medieval Western Europe but this does not imply that royalty or nobility themselves knew Latin it would suffice that a few clerks and emissaries did This other answer to this other question states that much of the lower clergy would know little or no Latin but this in turn does not mean knowledge of Latin was not common among the nobility So who would have a good or fair command of Latin medieval Western Europe Would there be conversations in Latin among royalty or nobility Would say noblemen of different native languages use Latin among themselves Would merchants The original version of this question asked about th – th century Christian Iberia which is what I’m particularly interested in But as it has attracted no answers I’m broadening the question so maybe someone will know something about some corner of Europe I’m limiting it to Western Europe as I think in the Orthodox East hardly anyone would know Latin

2024,history, Throughout the first millenium of Japanese history and before that even the Japanese rather steadily expanded up Honshu Once they had taken the whole of Honshu however they seemed largely to stop Throughout the Edo period their dealings with Hokkaido were very limited to just small scale trading posts there was never any serious attempt to actually expand there until the th century Why was this I dont think the Edo period and the need to keep the clans within reach of Tokyo was the whole story as this behaviour predates that too Ive also heard the story that it was down to Japanese ricebased agriculture not working in Hokkaidobut the weather of south Hokkaido isnt all that different to north Honshu Any ideas

2031,history, How can we explain the fall of Buddhism in India which is the geographic origin of Buddhism  Were there ever any direct conflicts between Hinduism and Buddhism  From what I understand the rise of Hinduism directly led to the decline of Buddhism The White Hun invasion in the th century followed by a series of other military invasions and conflicts definitely hurt the influence of Buddhism but these events seem disjoint and regionally limited  From wikipedia what exactly does this mean I am not satisfied with this explanation because Buddhism is strongly rooted in other Asian societies By that time Buddhism had become especially vulnerable to hostile rulers because it lacked strong roots in society as most of its adherents were ascetic communities httpenwikipediaorgwikiDeclineofBuddhisminIndia

2044,history, The Italian campaigns were finished in  The three chapters schism between the emperor and Pope came to a head Some popes were dragged to Constantinople This shows that the Emperor was exerting influence in Rome The Lombards invaded Italy in  In  the Vatican erected the sign of St Peter symbolizing its independence and the creation of the Papal States The Exarchate of Ravenna included a small strip of land through Perugia to Rome This is how Rome survived the Lombard invasions but was isolated enough to be independent It appears to be a fine line the empire could maintain the bridge but couldnt tell the popes what to do Im wondering if they actually tried to occupy Rome that they couldnt have handled both the Roman and Lombardian response and would have lost other Italian regions For example when Justinian II tried to arrest the Pope the people in Ravenna and inland rebelled before they even got to Rome Although I like TEDs story of hiding under the Popes bed more On the other hand if Rome wanted  assistance against Lombardia then constantinople could assist Rome via Perugia but then Constantinople would have wanted something in return

2046,history, I am trying to understand Japanese punitive expeditions in China such as the Three Alls Campaign and retaliation for the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo In each case the Japanese largely retaliated against Chinese civilians In order to understand these actions I need to understand the nature of the Japanese occupation of China better than I do Specifically I have come up with three different occupation models and I need to know which ones best describes what the Japanese were actually doing in China  Japan nominally occupied and ruled large chunks of China but with numerous leaks The above provocations and retaliations represented some of these leaks and attempts to plug them The nearest equivalent might be German antiSoviet partisan actions  Japans control of China was basically limited to a few large cities roads and railways but they had the ability to invade or roam the countryside when provoked Although the punitive actions were brutal they did not lead to a meaningful expansion of Japanese control of China over time and were more destructive than constructive conquering actions  The Japanese were engaged in a creeping takeover of China The above provocations merely reprioritized conquests that the Japanese had planned to undertake anyway perhaps somewhat later Unlike the previous case Japanese raids succeeded in not only taking but holding large territories formerly under Chinese control What if any military reasons caused the Japanese to undertake punitive expeditions in China and which of the above occupation models or others I may have overlooked best describes the context in which they occurred 
2047,interpersonal, Short Version I have a budding friendship with a coworker but recently said something incredibly stupid that has left them feeling justifiably hurt  While I think it would be best to give them time I am about to go on extended work leave and feel that if I dont try to resolve the issue now the friendship will completely wither and die by the time I return Long Version I am a married man dealing with some personal issues foremost among them is a lack of a proper support network of friends to talk to about the stress in my life  I have been trying to proactively get involved with new people through work so that I may eventually develop the kind of friendships I need Foremost among those I have begun to develop some comfort with regarding person topics is a female coworker   She is part of a larger crowd I have been going out for drinks with for the last few weeks  The other evening at such an outing I noticed a conspicuous simultaneous absence of her and another male coworker  After she left I made the regrettable choice to send a text asking if something was going on there with a good for you vibe  This was a poor choice in and of itself and justifiable anger resulted  My immediate apology included the phrase I only wished to let you know I am okay with whatever What makes it particularly horrific is I did not realize that male coworker was married  My choice of phrasing things has thus taken on a much darker meaning suggesting that I might be looking for similar attention  This was not my intent Normally I think it best to let tensions cool but given the magnitude of the error I left a followup apology by text the next day when I realized this  I explained that I would never wish to imply she was playing with married men Although she is a coworker in the broad sense I dont work with her directly  It has now been two days without any contact  I will go on extended leave in two more days  She probably doesnt realize the exact date my leave starts I realize that things are pretty bleak here in general  The only silverlinings is that she already knows I am a social idiot who doesnt really know how to approach friendship  This is something we had discussed previously The question What approach regarding timing is the leastbad option  Should I attempt to talk to her at work about the issue before I leave or should let it be I have also considered recruiting a mutual friend more hers than mine as a proxy to initiate conversation but that has its own complications 
2048,interpersonal, Selfhelp books have helped me a lot Now Ive run into a lot of stinkers but when one works it works But I realize I keep them all pretty close to the vest People do like to make fun of selfhelp especially when they know a lot And the selfhelp books never tell you how to deal with someone being snarky at you for reading them This isnt a critical problem but I realized I can put off a selfhelp book especially around friends who are pretty smart This nagging worry could even apply to visiting this website and potentially hearing Wow What do you need to visit that site for So I am wondering about an effective concise way to say back off without explicitly saying back off 
2049,interpersonal, I work in an office with a couple of vegan coworkers If I bring any animal products to lunch even cheese which they can smell Im likely to get a long earful about it In the past Ive listened patiently to their arguments for why I should change my eating habits but frankly Im tired of doing this  I just want to eat my lunch in peace and get back to work To be clear on that last point Ive nothing against veganism or vegans Im not trying to mock them or cause friction within the workplace Ive thought about the issue plenty and considered their arguments but Ive made up my mind to not change my diet Ive tried to find places to eat that wont be as noticeable for them  but it doesnt matter if Im at my desk or in the lounge  theyll still find me One of them makes a point of mentioning the rallies they attend or time spent picketing butcher shops  as a result I suspect they see these confrontations as less about me and more about a convenient opportunity to further this sort of activism  I could go to HR over this but Id prefer to find a way of resolving the issue quietly What is the best way to put an end to their attempts to get me to change my diet while also not setting myself up for future conflicts with them 
2050,interpersonal, I dont use social media Faceplace flutter you name it I really hate it and I avoid it  Unfortunately social media seems to be expected these days Like its a given that everybody uses it and loves it and posts on it habitually I dont and Im tired of being harassed about it What are some kind ways of putting that out there I would like to be friends with people but being a friend on Faceplace is completely out of the question If you have a link to something funny or interesting there are loads of better ways to reach me Whats a more effective way of wording that without lying so that I dont have to get up on my soapbox about why I dont use social media on a regular basis 
2051,interpersonal, I work at an IT MNC We have a large campus and many eateries Whenever we go out for eating he stands away from the payment queue and just tells what he would like to have At first I ignored it But after couple of months I started really noticing it He paid few times only when we go to comparatively cheaper places like tea stall Now I dont want to sound like a miser but now this has really started to annoy me  I dont want to sound rude to tell this to him How can I politely convey this message Edit He is neither financially weak nor does he portray himself financially weak The message I want to convey him is that What hes doing is inappropriate and can get real annoying Hes superior to me and earns significantly extra 
2052,interpersonal, After reading a related question I am rethinking about various discussionmeeting where I and most other leadersmoderators in the discussionmeeting call out someone for being quiet and not voicing their opinion The meetings were either casual or formal  and in both cases I call them because I dont want them to feel left out and I value the opinions of everyone The casual meetings usually dont have a specific goal hence just a discussion but more formal ones usually have specific goals Where will we go on the next holiday What will we do for our charity project This excludes work meetings All people know each other and most are friends and usually have only  persons Usually we go in a circle and start from a random person or the person next to the leader then take turns in voicing opinions Some usually skip or just agree with another person or are skipped because they take a long time to say something After everyone has taken their turn we get back to those that were skipped and ask for their opinion However there might be several questionsagendas and if the same persons keep quiet when its their turn we usually called them  Hey Alice why you so quiet What do you think about this A bit literal translation but the first part is a common phrase in Indonesian  In all cases the person is a bit surprised and usually either skip or giving a brief opinion or agree with someones else opinion It may be worthwhile to mention some of them were not paying attention That is always fine and we seldom press for their opinion after this another line  Come on what do you think about this  And drop it and progress to next person Although we would do this to all participants which most are shy there are some people that more often got pointed out because they more often keep quiet  Is it alright to call people out on a meetingdiscussion when they are being quiet 
2053,interpersonal, I just met one person and he seemed friendly and asked which department I work for etc  Is it okay if I ask his name in the short conversation so that I can say Hi the next time I meet him I am a bit confused because  It would be literally the third or fourth sentence in the whole conversation  I dont know how to actually ask the question without sounding abrupt   PS I am not an American or a native English speaker 
2054,interpersonal, I get a lot of strange compliments on my weight and I do not think I have ever been able to sort out an appropriate response  I get compliments about my weight and questions on how I stay so thin or lost weight after babies  I dont do anything specific for weight  I do try to be healthy and active but that is totally about feeling good and having good energy not about weight and frankly I dont think it impacts my weight  I eat more when I am active and naturally seem to eat less when I am not  I dont change size much when I am working out or not  I merely change the way my body feels moves posture etc based on muscle tone  I am not more likely to get this compliment if I am working out  days a week or not working out at all for months and months  People focus on overall size it seems not tone  The truth is its genes  Everyone in my family loses baby weight easily stays thin etc  Lifestyle has absolutely nothing to do with my weight never has and maybe never will  It is just genetic luck in my case I believe and I happen to have been born a person who loves healthy foods  My mother says I was the easiest child ever to feed and literally used to beg her to make me a whole pot of Brussels sprouts  It is really how I prefer to eat for my taste  I am not some awesome machine of will power  I love vegetables more than sweets even I dont like people thinking this is why because people do comment if they see me eat that this explains it because I have siblings that eat all fried and greasy and whatever and they are just as thin as I am and always have been  I do not think my food choice is why I am thin When I say that is just how it is I dont do anything it is met with either total disbelief like I dont want to tell them the secret or it makes me feel like it comes off as braggy or awkward no matter how I say it   Now if people simply told me I looked good then that is fine  I feel no weirdness there  Its when it worded differently I feel awkward on what to say  I can give you an example I have heard in various variations that is one I particularly disdain  I just wanted to tell you how great you look after having kids  So many moms today just let themselves go and you look as good as you did before the babies You took the weight right off  I hate this because it compliments me on something I actually didnt do while insulting the average mom which I want no part of  I simply do not know what to say that makes sense to such a remark in passing The person saying it also clearly always thinks they are paying me a massive compliment  I dont feel complimented at all  I feel like I was used for you to be able to spew out that you have a low opinion of the average mother these days and what I want to do is set you straight that your opinion on my weight is neither valuable nor warranted  I can tell you I have had this said to me in variations by anyone from teen to elderly and sometimes even other mothers who themselves placed a high priority to get in shape which is great for them if its about them but not great if you want to compliment me while calling other moms lazy Honestly I really usually dont reply  If I am walking I keep moving  If I am stuck like in conversation I literally just smile and ask if they can excuse me and insert something here like needing to find my kids spouse use the bathroom get home etc TLDR  read the quote  I do not know how to respond to a compliment about my weight because I didnt lose weight on purpose and I dont like how complimenting me gets blurred in with insulting other people who are not as thin and I am asking if there is a good way to respond to that type of compliment which I actually think is more a comment versus compliment

2057,interpersonal, My question is sortof related to this one but has the roles reversed Ive been overweight for at least  years and obese for approximately  Last February I decided to better my life Ive bought a fitness tracker started an eatinghabits diary and spent a few months trying to figure out what I should change  I came to realize that I should move more eat smaller portions and snack less surprise I also realized that I tend to overeat a lot on social occasions and when I am bored and that I am completely unable to turn down offers of foodsnacks After figuring out what I wanted to do I informed friends family and coworkers that I was going on a diet  I specifically asked them to not offer me food anymore For example I have a coworker that loves to share cookies on Fridays I asked him to just skip me until I told him I was ready to get offered food again Everybody reacted very nice and made a lot of promises of help  Thing is Ive been at it for three months and some people are letting their guard down They have started offering me food more and more often One of these people is my own mother I still live at home But also my grandma and my coworkers are forgetting my request a lot So lately Ive been offered food that I dont need and dont want to eat about three times a day  Im currently able to say no but it still takes me a lot of effort So that when I say no it will usually take three seconds and a screwed up face because I have to remind myself of my intentions Sometimes I snap and say something like   No Im on a diet and I asked you to help me remember   Ive also explained that although my diet is going well I am not ready yet for them to start offering me unhealthy foods at every turn It is difficult enough as it is to stick to my new healthy regimen  Lately some people have started calling me tedious They have compared me to the vegan person that always has to talk about being vegan I dont want to be like that but Im also certainly not ready yet for everybody to start treating me normally again  How can I verbally remind them of their promise to methe fact that Im still on a diet and dont want to be offered food that often without sounding like a broken record 
2058,interpersonal, Over the summer my daughter attended a day camp at her elementary school  Im trying to get reimbursed for it from my dependent care spending account but need a receipt from the teacher who ran it  I sent her an email a few weeks ago asking if she could provide a receipt and included an example that another teacher had done a camp at the school  Ive received no response   I tend to be abrupt and to the point in emails which has offended people in the past  Whats the best way to word this so it comes across as a polite request and not rude 
2059,interpersonal, I have a friend X who I have had to block on all social media after they have proven themselves to be  intense and demanding A trying to upset me B emotionally manipulative C having angry and aggressive overreactions to assumed slights D  extremely confrontational E angrily blames other people when they are at fault F a history of behaving this way towards others G  X noticed that I blocked them and confronted our mutual friend MF about it Demanding to know what they had done to upset me because as far as they could see we were great friends MF managed to evade the questions saying that we hadnt spoken in weeks MF is due to move home again soon and I worry that X will continue to pressure them for information when they return  knowing that MF will see me as soon as they arrive  I also worry that I will see X at events based on our mutual interests and they will confront me publicly in an aggressive and angry way as before as to why I blocked them  What should I do when I see them in public How do I avoid confrontation Or what is the best way to disengage from confrontation with an extremely confrontational person  An extensive history with evidence of AG can be read here httpspastebincomyrFzfz The key points are  Initially this was a primarily remote friendship which evolved from X being reverent to intense demanding and controlling over the course of about a year We have had one in person interaction  X was obnoxious negative complaining angrily overreacted to playful attempts to diffuse conflict ruined the event we attended overstayed their welcome in my home by  hours easily the worst guest Ive ever hosted and was angry at me for being too frightened to ask them to leave X is unreasonable and thinks that everyone else is being unreasonable landlord X regularly tries to upset me in conversations ignores me when I say no is relentless in trying to make me do what they want  Has previously shouted at me in front of a room full of my friends so seems to not have a problem with public conflict X has recently moved to my city and I could run into them at any time  I have had two close calls so far and in both contexts I was in disguise  A clarification MF is the only friend we have in common but our mutual interests will draw us to the same locations as they are niche 
2060,interpersonal, Maintaining focus on a single task until completing it might require a lot of effort to me While Im a talkative person and enjoy long conversations myself I still cant workstudy and talk at the same time  Usually I avoid this situation by wearing noisecanceling headphones and most people will just get it However one of my coworkers is also the type that enjoys talking for hours and shes unfazed by my cues She will often interrupt me to make small talk If I mention Im trying to focus on a task that requires my full attention she seems to understand for a few minutes but then come back with a workrelated topic that she manages to extend into a long conversation  I have also tried explaining that I use headphones because I cant work and talk at the same time and that I prefer to keep workrelated topics in written form so we can search it later if we need to Yet shell still find other ways asking if I also heard someone knocking on the door asking for help moving stuff around shes recovering from a hand injury asking for help with tech or English terminology even getting me coffee so Id have to say if I wanted sugar on it Bear in mind shes a really nice person and shell act similarly with other people around Of course when theres someone else at the office they soak up her attention and I dont get interrupted as often Our managers are aware of her behavior and they dont mind so I have no intention to make a formal complaint What should I do to keep these conversations to a minimum Even if she needs my help Id rather be messaged first we have corporate instant messaging at our disposal but theyre not enforced and attend her when Im ready instead of being interrupted unless its an actual emergency  I want to avoid being blunt with her if possible but Im running out of ideas of how to make it work 
2061,interpersonal, I’m a graduate working in another industry than the one I studied for my BA so I’m undertaking lots of external training relevant to my job Ive been studying quite hard and have been doing really well in the exams Sometimes a coworker will ask how I’ve performed in the exam and usually I try to answer vaguely because I don’t want them to think I’m showing off and also to avoid the awkward question that usually follows “Wow you must be really smart” In university I would have been fine saying something like “I did fine” or “Well I passed” and people wouldn’t tend to pry However I find that people in work tend to keep asking until I tell them the specific grade and then I feel like I’ve created even more of a fuss by being purposely avoidant On the other hand if I try to be straightforward from the start and tell them my score outright I end up feeling like I’m bragging especially because I’m trying not to and can never figure out if I should smilelook neutral etc and in my discomfort I may end up reverting to aloofness So I’m wondering what’s the best way to answer questions about my grades to avoid sounding arrogant or inviting further comments about my intelligence  For context Im in Europe

2085,interpersonal, I recently graduated college and I am now working as a programmer at a startup tech company for a year  Im a competent programmer but Im definitely not a rockstar   When Im meeting other young adults or college students and I tell them what I do they often seem impressed and ask something like so you must be really smart or is what you do really hard  I feel like saying yes would make me seem arrogant so I usually respond by saying I think Im doing well enough  This ends up being awkward and also undersells the actual work that I have done So how do I answer this honestly without being rude  
2086,interpersonal, A few days ago when I was in office washroom I saw my colleague leave the tap opened while applying handwash I asked him to never waste water like this again and quickly closed the tap After that he said that there is no water problem here In reply I said that it doesnt matter whether there is a water problem or not you shouldnt waste water like this The situation was about to get out of hand when my team lead approached and handled it calmly However things are now bad between me and my colleague So my question is how do I ask someone to stop wasting water like this without sounding rude or hurting their feelings so I can prevent such situations in future 
2087,interpersonal, My girlfriend and I have fixed days we see each other because we normally dont have time on other days Sometimes it happens that her training gets cancelled and she has time that evening and most times I do have time too I am fine if she then asks if we want to meet and I say Yes The circumstances I am not fine with meeting is if we met like four days in a row and over the weekend we often spend the whole h together and then her training got cancelled On these occasions I do want to have some time for myself eg playing PC games I need this from time to time to relax fully and therefore I decline her question if I want to meet Whenever I decline it hurts her feelings I do understand that rejection hurts so I would like to be able to tell her I dont want to meet without hurting her She does know that I need from time to time a bit of time to relax for myself and she does understand it I already thought about having her think about it if I want to meet in that day by herself but I think if she does this and comes to the conclusion that I dont want to meet it will hurt her just the same I am really out of ideas on how to handle these situations We are both from the same culture and country Germany She is close to  and I am  I already told her that I sometimes need time for myself its not a scheduled meeting or something its my spare time

2095,interpersonal, This question is being asked on behalf of a good friend of mine I was not directly involved in the scenario This past semester a friend of mine in college was going to have his girlfriend over to spend a day and a Sunday night in his dorm room The two of them have a longdistance relationship because they go to colleges over eight hours apart The visit had been planned for about two months and all the arrangements had been made  tickets were bought a schedule was developed and my friends roommate was notified one month in advance and asked for his consent The roommate agreed to spend the night elsewhere sexiling as I believe its called and my friend was able to get two other friends to host him with an air mattress and sheets Unfortunately two weeks before the visit the roommate found that he had a moderately important test the next day a Monday He told my friend that he was now reluctant about moving because he stated that he could not sleep well elsewhere and wanted to sleep in his room My friend was annoyed by this though he had some sympathy After a short discussion after asking my friends girlfriend they came to a compromise where the roommate would sleep in their room while the girlfriend was there but the couple would go to sleep long before he came back from studying It was a very awkward arrangement but it worked My friend and I have asked quite a few friends about this since then and theyve unanimously said that the roommate should have kept his promise My friend agreed but still had sympathy for his roommate theyve always been on very good terms and the roommate did well on the test The question my friend has is this Would it have been rude for him to be more assertive and continue to ask his friend to leave for the night

2099,interpersonal, tldr My hot tempered grandmother has gotten even more short fused and unpredictable with age which has lead to conflict with my mother who lives with her and me who lives abroad but calls weekly How can I address the conflict without harming the relationship  I love my grandmother She had a great role to play as I grew up However as time passes the effect of age brings issues that I find very hard to deal with  The most important aspects to remark are as I see it  Ive been living abroad for a couple of years but Ive made it a point to call home once per week more than that is not possible due to time difference and technical constraints My mother lives with her I was visiting home a couple of months ago  Her memory fades She remembers us and some things like the fact that Im abroad but she forgets the names of things and often what weve said  She tends to draw dramatic consequences from prosaic events For instance if I call earlier than the last few times she will assume I had an accident or something along the lines  She doesnt hear well and often pretends to have understood when in fact she didnt My mother is often nearby and helps her in such cases and I got her some good noiseisolating headphones but it is still a major obstacle It is often enough that I tell her about my week and reassure her whenever she has some misled fear However occasionally it is not Last time I was visiting I offered to cook sometimes periodically but sporadically every Sunday for instance It was at first welcomed and even praised but once she decided that it meant we were forcing her to eat a specific thing and refused to eat My mother tried to remark that it was a rude thing to do and my grandmother entered a selfdeprecating state where she claims she is a burden Just yesterday I was in the middle of our usual conversation with my mother after which I would normally talk to my grandmother Apparently my mother took the call from another room as she uses to and my grandmother interpreted that as a red flag As my mother tried to minimize the fact and explained that it was just circumstantial my grandmother assumed we were hiding information from her and refused to take the call After some attempt of mediation she took it rudely asked for news and left after a minute I was absolutely confused and couldnt think of anything to keep her on the phone for longer My mother also reproached her behaviour this time remarking that her my grandmothers words may be hurtful for us who love her I try to understand all the complexity that comes with age and hope to find a way to reduce the stress and anxiety on my grandmother However this is passing a toll on my mothers nerves and mine We dont know how to address these scenarios and whenever they come they ruin everyones mood and peace So finally my question is How could my mother and I prevent these reactions from my grandmother from escalating ideally while also preventing them to happen often in the future  Edit  As requested in the comments I update the question to remark that it has been a problem for years and throughout that time her doctors have dismissed the situation as normal for her age and never pointer to Alzheimers 
2100,interpersonal, So I draw little caricaturedoodles for fun and am decently good at it Sometimes people ask me very casually not for pay or anything to draw them What if this person is overweight or has an obvious flaw like a big nose or acne Should I draw that in or try to make them look attractive  Now I know a really selfconscious person wont ask me to draw them in the first place but nobody has  self confidence Do people expect me to make them look attractive even if they know they are not However if I leave off a flaw then the drawing will not resemble the person Also not drawing in an obvious flaw will ironically highlight it because it says Ive noticed it and know it is unattractive enough to modify my drawing  Is it considered rude to ASK such a thing Sometimes asking is considered bad like if somebody wants to know if they are fat and you respond with do you want the truth or flattery Im much in the same position Ok to stick very close to the interpersonal skills guidelines here are my official questions  Do I modify my drawing or not This is an action to be taken in response to the interpersonal situation of offending somebody by highlighting their flaws  Is it rude to ask directly if I should make them more attractive  What phrasing should I use in  such that the phrasing doesnt overtly say should I cover up your ugliness  and  are subject to the person LYING to me then magically expecting me to know how to act Americans love to do this So this brings me back to

2104,interpersonal, Hello this is my first question here and topic tells a lot Im not a network person even with internet Im not preferred to communicate but just eye shopping for getting what I want But I realized somewhat Ive been stuck a lot with difficult situation sometimes I solved but other I failed I realized the network itself a huge impact on ones life And the Fails was usually the result that I tried myself alone even didnt think to get a single help Realize that I feel trapped Im programmer I become what I want to be I solved a lot of problems and bugs but with this subject I failed a lot Sometimes I think myself as the buggy software runs on spaghetti code hard to refactor 
2105,interpersonal, Maintaining focus on a single task until completing it might require a lot of effort to me While Im a talkative person and enjoy long conversations myself I still cant workstudy and talk at the same time  Usually I avoid this situation by wearing noisecanceling headphones and most people will just get it However one of my coworkers is also the type that enjoys talking for hours and shes unfazed by my cues She will often interrupt me to make small talk If I mention Im trying to focus on a task that requires my full attention she seems to understand for a few minutes but then come back with a workrelated topic that she manages to extend into a long conversation  I have also tried explaining that I use headphones because I cant work and talk at the same time and that I prefer to keep workrelated topics in written form so we can search it later if we need to Yet shell still find other ways asking if I also heard someone knocking on the door asking for help moving stuff around shes recovering from a hand injury asking for help with tech or English terminology even getting me coffee so Id have to say if I wanted sugar on it Bear in mind shes a really nice person and shell act similarly with other people around Of course when theres someone else at the office they soak up her attention and I dont get interrupted as often Our managers are aware of her behavior and they dont mind so I have no intention to make a formal complaint What should I do to keep these conversations to a minimum Even if she needs my help Id rather be messaged first we have corporate instant messaging at our disposal but theyre not enforced and attend her when Im ready instead of being interrupted unless its an actual emergency  I want to avoid being blunt with her if possible but Im running out of ideas of how to make it work 
2106,interpersonal, I have rather strong political convictions I have a friend at work who has an opposite conviction in many areas and who pushes toward discussion  While I believe that reasonable and rational people can disagree on those topics the problem is that they dont know very much about economics while economics was for a long time my passion Im trying to tell him that there is much more nuance to the topic than he thinks people write PhDs on those topics and there might be effects to his proposed policies that run contrary to his stated goals and some problems with details of his approach  I end up being called essentially a bad person who depends on a theoretical approach and only holds those views due to his socioeconomic status Ironically I get better with friends whose views I think of as dangerous and fundamentally misguided but who can show some respect for my views Now Im struggling with mental health issues and those discussions cost me a lot  after the last one I had a large attack of my mental problem How should I tell him to stop Im not necessarily inclined to share with him my medical problems Were in the US but we are both from Eastern Europe Culturally it is much more permissive for us to discuss politics unfortunately Also because of isolation people from my country do form a clique and many informationgossip is just shared 
2107,interpersonal, As you may have heard recently an earthquake hit mexico city and we had a lot of lost livesbuildingsmoneyetc  I recently heard about the existences of an app such that warnings you at least a few seconds that an earthquake is coming Ive looking on google about it and I have found a lot of applications that warnings you about an earthquake however Ive read the comments too the opinion of the users   and it turns out the comments are really bad about the apps they say the app didnt work on th september or this app doesnt warnings you it just tells you about what has been already happened in the world and earthquakes I would like to know if any of you have an application like the one Im looking for that is an application that tells you a few seconds before that an earthquake is yet to come  Any suggestion or advice is very welcome 
2108,interpersonal, Introduction This question is different from this excellent one since it is not about tourists The differences will become clear later on I hope I will as usual use fake names Alice and Eve this time and also name places L A and New York that do not need to coincide with the actual cities Alice is a US citizen born and raised in the US Her name is very uncommon though And her appearance doesnt match Average Janes entirely Eve is nice and openminded and looks more like your Average Jane Situation I met with Alice and Eve who didnt know each other before in New York I do know both so I was the common denominator It was nothing formal just a nice evening at home After some introduction like where I met Alice and Eve for the first time a dialogue between Eve and Alice ensued  Eve Where are you from Alice Im from Los Angeles My whole family lives there Eve I love L A But where are you from originally Alice short pause Also L A I was born there  Eve didnt seem to notice anything and they went on After hearing the question I looked at Alice to see her reaction and although it was subtle I do think that she wasnt glad about Where are you from originally Also she seemed a bit more reserved afterwards On a sidenote Eve also told a lot about herself it was not a onesided questioning At the end Eve said that it was a nice evening and Alice was great but maybe a bit distanced I said that I felt that question to have been rude She disagreed noting how I was being oversensitive and how she loves foreign cultures She just had wanted to get to know her better and was genuinely interested Now Alice was polite and said that she had enjoyed the evening and how Eve was a nice person She didnt complain but I doubt she would have fearing it may hurt me I also didnt want to pressure her for the sake of my couriosity So I just gave her the chance to voice her opinion in case she wanted to and decided to ask the community here Question Is it rude to ask someone Where are you from originally Is there maybe a better way to phrase the question Please note that this is not about proving me and my reasoning right Im genuinely interested in how such a question is perceived And this is in contrast to the other question not about tourists or the like While Eve didnt know Alice there was no reason to suggest that she was e g a tourist And there may be cases where just the name is very uncommon Average Jane Someone youd see in a TV ad representing the audience 
2109,interpersonal, My boyfriend smokes tobacco Once in a while he might roll a joint It helps him relax I dont mind it because its not on a daily basis Both my mother and his parents know about it I actually worry more about the effects of tobacco  Sometimes my mother visits us and there had been a couple of times where he happened to do it in front of her knowing that she knows about it My mom is a very discreet person and never said anything so far to indicate it had bothered her I certainly thought it hadnt  Recently though and after watching some documentary about the effects of smoking in general she told me she doesnt feel as comfortable  Boyfriend doesnt smoke right in her face and almost always asks if parents mind if visiting His dad lets him smoke inside the house but my mom and his mom dont do that Mom is concerned a lot and she wants to say something about it but she doesnt know how to approach it since its not really her business whether he smokes or not I dont want her to say anything but I dont want her to stop visiting either I told her that Id rather she never came by the house again than saying the wrong thing at the wrong time I dont want this escalating We are in our thirties My mom has an increased concern about my boyfriends health because of the smoking and the fact that I am a passive smoker which is understandable People smoke He is one of them Do I particularly like that he smokes NO But I cant make him stop I know my moms concerns are valid and that she feels uncomfortable about it but she tends to be a bit stubborn about it and not wanting to drop the subject Not saying shes wrong but she tends to lecture me about it  How do I address these concerns  If I decide to tell my boyfriend about it how can I tell him to minimize conflict Is there anything my mom can say next time she visits that wont make things awkward and potentially cause a fight  
2110,interpersonal, My girlfriend and I have fixed days we see each other because we normally dont have time on other days Sometimes it happens that her training gets cancelled and she has time that evening and most times I do have time too I am fine if she then asks if we want to meet and I say Yes The circumstances I am not fine with meeting is if we met like four days in a row and over the weekend we often spend the whole h together and then her training got cancelled On these occasions I do want to have some time for myself eg playing PC games I need this from time to time to relax fully and therefore I decline her question if I want to meet Whenever I decline it hurts her feelings I do understand that rejection hurts so I would like to be able to tell her I dont want to meet without hurting her She does know that I need from time to time a bit of time to relax for myself and she does understand it I already thought about having her think about it if I want to meet in that day by herself but I think if she does this and comes to the conclusion that I dont want to meet it will hurt her just the same I am really out of ideas on how to handle these situations We are both from the same culture and country Germany She is close to  and I am  I already told her that I sometimes need time for myself its not a scheduled meeting or something its my spare time

2112,interpersonal, This question is being asked on behalf of a good friend of mine I was not directly involved in the scenario This past semester a friend of mine in college was going to have his girlfriend over to spend a day and a Sunday night in his dorm room The two of them have a longdistance relationship because they go to colleges over eight hours apart The visit had been planned for about two months and all the arrangements had been made  tickets were bought a schedule was developed and my friends roommate was notified one month in advance and asked for his consent The roommate agreed to spend the night elsewhere sexiling as I believe its called and my friend was able to get two other friends to host him with an air mattress and sheets Unfortunately two weeks before the visit the roommate found that he had a moderately important test the next day a Monday He told my friend that he was now reluctant about moving because he stated that he could not sleep well elsewhere and wanted to sleep in his room My friend was annoyed by this though he had some sympathy After a short discussion after asking my friends girlfriend they came to a compromise where the roommate would sleep in their room while the girlfriend was there but the couple would go to sleep long before he came back from studying It was a very awkward arrangement but it worked My friend and I have asked quite a few friends about this since then and theyve unanimously said that the roommate should have kept his promise My friend agreed but still had sympathy for his roommate theyve always been on very good terms and the roommate did well on the test The question my friend has is this Would it have been rude for him to be more assertive and continue to ask his friend to leave for the night 
2113,interpersonal, TLDR How do I to tell a judgemental person with unsubstantiated statements making it a clear and definitive statement that she may not move things around in our office That person Ill call her Alice isnt businessrelated but is familyrelated to my business partner Alice always criticizes not directly with words but rather with small actions  Background I run a small business with a founding partner FP Ive known for years and worked with before We did everything by ourselves but one thing we needed legal and businessmarketing advice from someone and my FPs motherinlaw Alice had that name in her professional address book She introduced us to the person all went fine we thanked her Before we opened we had all the stuff put in the office from desks to PC to flowers and paintings well everything to have a nice and functional environmentworkplace  weeks later we set up a small and friendly Opening Party inviting family friends and some neighbours What Alice did twice before the opening date and at the opening party was moving things around saying its much better here itll look good here or you cant have this here And so on No matter why we want and need things organized one way for customers or ourselves shell step in and mess the whole thing up What I did  say nothing and put stuff back to its place say nicely kind of slightly joking tone we need it here for  X  reason you know and put stuff back to its place  Notes  I didnt know her before my FP suggested he asks her for help once on our behalf We often have customers saying that our office is cute feels warm and welcoming To me Alices one of the most selfish arrogant and disdainful people Ive ever met Her words and gestures carry the highest level of lack of respect Ive seen in ones behaviour No need to say I avoid her anytime I can as I believe shes not as she thinks the best person in the world the only one that Earth is worth feeding with such a good taste and the only one who knows perfectly how it works and how things should be done This happens at the workplace but is more related to IPS as its not about customerstaff relationship which I can handle in a professional manner FP is  with me and will let me handle it my way Alice works at a place very close to our office Her daughter FPs GF comes to pick him up for lunch or after work They find it convenient to meet at ours GF thinks her mothers the best on earth nothing wrong with her  So far I just talk to my FP and my GF about her and they both agree roughly no comment about such a personality and behaviour Alice is irritating and now next time she comes around and starts over again I feel like I wont be able to remain calm and at the very least restrain myself from throwing her a pointedacerbic comment I even thought about telling her that shes not welcome to visit us anymore As I dont owe her anything but respect and I dont want to hurt my FP feelings or put him in trouble Im looking for a goodbetter way to handle this irritating situation

2123,interpersonal, Soooo This week Im quite sick but not the kind of sickness that could prevent me from working at least if it doesnt worsen at some point It is not contagious at all by the way So I can freely work in my open space as usual Yet I need to take some medication to feel better and I have no choice but to take it at the beginning of my working day Due to some side effects I just cant take it before going to work I need to take it at the beginning of my work and also during my lunch My problem is one of my coworker is particulary inquisitive and keen on good gossips To say the least he is a gossip and thus Id like to avoid having to answer anything about my disease It is the kind of shameful one that would make me very uncomfortable if anyone outside of my relatives knew about it  I need to avoid his questions and if possible Id like to do it smoothly With that kind of people being aggressive or acting like being on the defensive will most likely trigger his curiosity and hunger for tasty information So how can I dismiss his question without being rude or triggering even more questions  As of now Im working in France but I dont know if that is very relevant

2125,interpersonal, It seems to me that its sometimes difficult to both stay within the social protocol and also communicate your intentions clearly  As an example of this I once asked a girl I knew out to see a movie At the time we were both in our early twenties and had known each other for a few months but only saw each other rarely times per month When we did get the chance to talk though we could talk for hours As soon as I realized that I was attracted to her I asked her out I did this in person and made it as clear as I could that it was going to be just the two of us and that its not going to be like our regular interactions  The date itself went great we both seemed to enjoy it there was a clear flirtatious atmosphere and just in general it seemed to have that first date feeling one tends to experience in such situations especially when young We watched a movie went for a walk and finally decided to sit down in a random coffee shop Again none of this seemed out of the ordinary for a dateand honestly still doesnt When we were finally done with our coffee and started slowly heading home I started moving the conversation towards setting up the next date and to my surprise she literally asked me Was this a date and seemed genuinely surprised that I considered it one  Was there anything that I could have done from the start to avoid this situation  
2126,interpersonal, Each day I drive through a heavily wooded area in a nature reservation in the United States The roads have many twists turns and hills and the speed limit is  miles per hour Cars going much faster are likely to crash There are few if any places to turn off guardrails embankments and a footwide shoulder make pulling over virtually impossible There are also no passing zones I normally drive at the speed limit or a little bit below  mph on the worst sections because even though I know the area well its still not as safe as say a nice flat side street However over the last week Ive had several cases where a person is tailgating me  typically an SUV roughly two or three feet behind my rear bumper I seem to have a couple choices  I could go faster and risk injuring myself and any other vehicles cyclists or nearby pedestrians This also means that Id have less time to stop at wildlife crossings which are fairly common on these roads Enough collisions with animals happen already in the area I could go the same speed and continue to annoy the driver I could attempt to pull off at one or two spots but the other driver is so close that Im afraid to slow down while I pull off  they could still hit me  I could of course go slower but that would simply be obnoxious At the moment I use the second option and I should be clear Im not asking for advice on what the best thing to do is Id prefer to be safe above all else and thats the safest solution for everyone involved although its not my personal responsibility to decide how fast another vehicle should go On the other hand its always possible that the other vehicle needs to get somewhere for an emergency  and that worries me a bit Is it rude for me to stay with the second option Id prefer safety above courtesy of course but it still bugs me a bit Having them tailgate me when they want to go faster is also a bit dangerous 
2127,interpersonal, Background I work for a very small company thats been around a long time we do a mix of processing customer products and consultancy work We have a reasonable mix of customers working for multiple departments of some of the larger ones The problem Its a feast or famine industry and some of our customers need us purely because of their lack of organisation This means that for some customers their capacity requirements vary weekly and unpredictably Sometimes its really quiet and were having to search for work sometimes were super busy and we get a lot of projects come in at same time usually around the time someones on holiday and obviously some customers have to wait while we work on other customers projectsproducts No one likes to hear and I dont like saying theyre not the number one priority So what is a good way to tell a customer that were working on another project and well work on theirs insert time frame here Note Im not asking about how to manage projectsresources just how to explain to customers we are low on capacity 
2128,interpersonal, I recently graduated college and I am now working as a programmer at a startup tech company for a year  Im a competent programmer but Im definitely not a rockstar   When Im meeting other young adults or college students and I tell them what I do they often seem impressed and ask something like so you must be really smart or is what you do really hard  I feel like saying yes would make me seem arrogant so I usually respond by saying I think Im doing well enough  This ends up being awkward and also undersells the actual work that I have done So how do I answer this honestly without being rude  
2129,interpersonal, I am a secondgeneration American of Middle Eastern South Asian origin working in a big city in the USA where there is a subway Usually someone is selling newspapers in the morning For the past year there has been this creepylooking person in my opinion selling newspapers This person looks like a cunning criminal type Although I cannot give you evidence of this it is my gut feeling which we are encouraged to trust while encountering a stranger  He tends to go up to people say hello ask them for a highfive I even see people stop and talk to him Then last year when I was minding my own business he came up to me and asked for a highfive I was really scared of saying no because one time when I refused someone who was soliciting money they got really aggressive and I almost had to call the cops on them I and my family do not have good experiences with officials and prefer not to involve any officials in this matter So for a year I reluctantly gave highfives and acted like I was happy about it  Then a few months ago I saw a video on computer security and the person presenting it said something interesting You are an adult say no So the next day when I was in the subway and this person wanted a highfive I gave a thumbs up and said this is easy for me Then he thought I am celebrating Ramadan hence I am not giving highfive I look Muslim plus I wear long skirts He asked if I am fasting for Ramadan and I said yes just to end the conversation right then and there Now its way past Ramadan and the person jokingly asks for highfive I am polite and say have a nice day Believe it or not many nd generation Americans retain a lot of mindset for better or worse from their ancestral country Plus I keep hearing that acid attacks are now coming to Western countries like France and the UK My ancestral background is from a culture where such attacks against women are not uncommon So honestly I am really scared of random interactions with unknown people  I also want to avoid angering anyone  I wish I can smile and give a friendly nod and pass by but not talk or give him a highfive My concern is if I interact with him more my boundaries will be overstepped and I wont know how to deescalate It is hard to ignore a person who you have no choice but to pass by each day if he oversteps my boundaries Many members have commented that my fears about this person seem irrational I dont think they are irrational but that argument doesnt invalidate my question anyway because I have a right to avoid him if I want to whatever the reason To get around that controversial point let us simply assume that I am extremely shy and want to avoid interacting with this person for that reason how do I do it tactfully without antagonizing this person QUESTION How to avoid interacting with this person and how can I politely communicate my lack of interest verbally or nonverbally preferred without upsetting him myself or any surrounding people 
2130,interpersonal, I just had a conversation with my father about a job application in which they wanted to know if I ever had any traffic violations   Now as far as I can remember Ive never been busted for speeding the only issue Ive ever had was being pulled over a few times for not having a licence plate sticker When discussing this my father said something like that doesnt count only moving violations count I told him that since I was pulled over maybe it would count as a moving violation never mind that the words moving violation was not even mentioned in the job application text He got really angry and said that I should know what a moving violation is I told him that Ive never been pulled over for speeding as far as I can remember so how would I know what a moving violation is He told me that ignorance is no excuse for not knowing the law and that I should know about this from talking to other people the only people Ive talked to who have said things about this have been drunk drivers I met in college I told him that I was sorry that I was so boring that I had never been pulled over for speeding or drinking He got really angry and said dont think that I would want you to have been pulled over for drunk driving I assumed that he wanted me to have done this because in order to get any experience with that part of the law thats what I would have had to have done I dont understand the situation or the anger on his part  This does remind me of another story from my youth I was in the th grade My teacher told me to give the names of the months in order I hadnt learn that yet at that point so I just told her I dont know the months of the year in order I was yelled at and sent to the office What can I do about this How can I handle the situation when dealing with someone like my father or a teacher at school 
2131,interpersonal, Maintaining focus on a single task until completing it might require a lot of effort to me While Im a talkative person and enjoy long conversations myself I still cant workstudy and talk at the same time  Usually I avoid this situation by wearing noisecanceling headphones and most people will just get it However one of my coworkers is also the type that enjoys talking for hours and shes unfazed by my cues She will often interrupt me to make small talk If I mention Im trying to focus on a task that requires my full attention she seems to understand for a few minutes but then come back with a workrelated topic that she manages to extend into a long conversation  I have also tried explaining that I use headphones because I cant work and talk at the same time and that I prefer to keep workrelated topics in written form so we can search it later if we need to Yet shell still find other ways asking if I also heard someone knocking on the door asking for help moving stuff around shes recovering from a hand injury asking for help with tech or English terminology even getting me coffee so Id have to say if I wanted sugar on it Bear in mind shes a really nice person and shell act similarly with other people around Of course when theres someone else at the office they soak up her attention and I dont get interrupted as often Our managers are aware of her behavior and they dont mind so I have no intention to make a formal complaint What should I do to keep these conversations to a minimum Even if she needs my help Id rather be messaged first we have corporate instant messaging at our disposal but theyre not enforced and attend her when Im ready instead of being interrupted unless its an actual emergency  I want to avoid being blunt with her if possible but Im running out of ideas of how to make it work

2133,interpersonal, My girlfriend and I have fixed days we see each other because we normally dont have time on other days Sometimes it happens that her training gets cancelled and she has time that evening and most times I do have time too I am fine if she then asks if we want to meet and I say Yes The circumstances I am not fine with meeting is if we met like four days in a row and over the weekend we often spend the whole h together and then her training got cancelled On these occasions I do want to have some time for myself eg playing PC games I need this from time to time to relax fully and therefore I decline her question if I want to meet Whenever I decline it hurts her feelings I do understand that rejection hurts so I would like to be able to tell her I dont want to meet without hurting her She does know that I need from time to time a bit of time to relax for myself and she does understand it I already thought about having her think about it if I want to meet in that day by herself but I think if she does this and comes to the conclusion that I dont want to meet it will hurt her just the same I am really out of ideas on how to handle these situations We are both from the same culture and country Germany She is close to  and I am  I already told her that I sometimes need time for myself its not a scheduled meeting or something its my spare time 
2134,interpersonal, I have a friend X who I have had to block on all social media after they have proven themselves to be  intense and demanding A trying to upset me B emotionally manipulative C having angry and aggressive overreactions to assumed slights D  extremely confrontational E angrily blames other people when they are at fault F a history of behaving this way towards others G  X noticed that I blocked them and confronted our mutual friend MF about it Demanding to know what they had done to upset me because as far as they could see we were great friends MF managed to evade the questions saying that we hadnt spoken in weeks MF is due to move home again soon and I worry that X will continue to pressure them for information when they return  knowing that MF will see me as soon as they arrive  I also worry that I will see X at events based on our mutual interests and they will confront me publicly in an aggressive and angry way as before as to why I blocked them  What should I do when I see them in public How do I avoid confrontation Or what is the best way to disengage from confrontation with an extremely confrontational person  An extensive history with evidence of AG can be read here httpspastebincomyrFzfz The key points are  Initially this was a primarily remote friendship which evolved from X being reverent to intense demanding and controlling over the course of about a year We have had one in person interaction  X was obnoxious negative complaining angrily overreacted to playful attempts to diffuse conflict ruined the event we attended overstayed their welcome in my home by  hours easily the worst guest Ive ever hosted and was angry at me for being too frightened to ask them to leave X is unreasonable and thinks that everyone else is being unreasonable landlord X regularly tries to upset me in conversations ignores me when I say no is relentless in trying to make me do what they want  Has previously shouted at me in front of a room full of my friends so seems to not have a problem with public conflict X has recently moved to my city and I could run into them at any time  I have had two close calls so far and in both contexts I was in disguise  A clarification MF is the only friend we have in common but our mutual interests will draw us to the same locations as they are niche

2256,law, this question refers to the law in the UK Ive moved out of an apartment and my previous landlord is asking me to pay to repaint the bathroom as its crumbling because of condensation When we moved in the bathroom paint was already crumbled but is probably worse when we moved out This is due to condensation as theres no active fan extractor Theres only a passive vent that doesnt do anything It looks like this   The bathroom has a window but its facing my neighbors other window who is  meters away For privacy reason the window cant be opened during bathroom use We have done everything possible to create an airflow after the bathroom use but its not enough to eliminate the condensation The landlord thinks that I havent ventilated the bathroom properly and ask me to pay for repaint which is more than £ and will be taken out of the deposit I will be willing to pay only if the landlord had installed everything that could help getting the condensation out This is not the case Weve tried to resolve this dispute by email but it is not getting anywhere I dont want to pay for something where I did no wrong doing The next step would be to resolve this dispute through the Deposit Protection Service I can prove that the bathroom is not well designed for condensation extraction What is the law regarding bathroom ventilation What are my chances to have the DPS ruled in my favor as I can demonstrate plenty of things

2258,law, Im wondering if there is solid legal ground for suing the US government for using an electoral college which can have the effect of denying citizens a vote My argument is that the electoral college violates a citizens right to a vote because it  effectively changes your vote to match that of the majority in your state or congressional district if youre in Maine or Nebraska and because  it gives some citizens a stronger vote than others due to what state they live in  The electoral college altering your vote to match the majority seems to be the most egregious crime because although the constitution doesnt explicitly require your vote to be equal in strength surely the founders intended with the word vote that you at least get to choose who you vote for  I understand the constitution does not explicitly guarantee that all votes must be equal nor does it ban geographic voter discrimination and that it does call for an electoral college so I see the counter argument would be strong but I wonder if you guys think there is any case to be made for my argument 
2259,law, Im reading up on EUs GDPR in relation to an anonymization product I am working on The one section that has raised a few questions is article   The right to erasure or more popularly referred to as Forget me My assumption is that the functionality will have to consist of a mix of deletion of records and anonymization Especially where there are transactional data that cannot be deleted or for that sake cannot be legally deleted  Another assumption about the procedures is that the enduser will have to be notified in advance about the Forget me job with a date and time It would be impossible to notify after the job has been done because then you would need the information that has just been erased Of course if the customer calls at the date given then customer service would have no records of this customer and would not be able to search by any information given Accountability In this respect what about all logs of work done Emails sent would necessarily have the mailto address stored I believe there is a conflict of laws you are legally bound to keep log of messages since it documents work done but on the other hand you cannot know who this person is You could anonymize the email address but then again what about the content of the communication Backups Does the law also mean that backups will have to Forget That would be very impractical with writeonce or streaming type media How about backups prior to  Backups may legally have to be stored for  years but some would want to store them even longer

2262,law, A number of job recruiters who call me seem to be calling over a bad connection and have a pretty thick accent  This in itself is not an indication that they are calling from abroad but is there a general requirement on a person working with a recruiter to make sure that the recruiter is authorized to work in the US   Specifically if they are hiring individuals who are US citizens on US soil and they are hiring for work at employers US locations  It seems like these recruiters are out of the reach of the US law and yet they are making decisions which are fairly heavily regulated in the US such as employment decisions The Labor Department cannot regulate their actions either if their entire organization is abroad  Could I be on the hook for conspiring to go around the US law if I go along with them without first ensuring that they can legally work in the US

2264,law, Countries laws regarding incorporation or opening of a branchsubsidiary of a foreignowned company are often different especially in regards to tax status than a fully local company  Suppose the majority shareholder of a US corporation holds foreign citizenship Could they elect to form a fully local company in that foreign country and then give the US corporation some kind of De Facto ownership of that foreign corporation without triggering a conversion event for that corporation into a foreign corporation governed by local laws on foreign corporations  Determination of foreign status is usually determined by foreign ownership of shares So while transferring of shares would most likely require converting into a foreignowned corporation what I am really wondering is if some type of De Facto ownership might be possible Ie a contract in perpetuity granting certain rights and restrictions to both corporations or a contract dictating the eventual ownership of the corporation Would such a contract or other De Facto mechanism if it exists require a tax event eg the acquisition of an asset Could any rights not be given De Facto via Contract that the US company would hold under strict legal ownership Lastly is there any precedent for this type of structure I know of precedent whereas a US corporation supports a members creation of a new company with the understanding that they will later purchase the company at a muchreduced price I am unsure however of the legal structure surrounding this Jurisdiction for Parent Company Ca USA 
2265,law, I am contemplating going to the courts over an issue that has persistent for decades in my area Cattle rustling has really affected the livelihoods of the people of Samburu North Constituency Northern Kenya  Over the last two decades since s the government of Kenya has engaged he issue in different approaches and currently we have  military camps in Baragoi area  in my view they have failed to protect the people and their property This is an area with two warring communities Samburu maasai and the Turkana I can state with facts that the samburu community has lost almost  of its young generation the morans through this problem For example in the year   youths died in one incident  in  again another  died in similar incident In  one of my relatives was shot while grazing alongside  others and all died and about  heads of cattle driven away by the bandits from the other community  Just a week a go  people died again due to exchange of fire this time the issue was grazing area brought the quarrel  There are contless other small incidents that led to loss of life between this communities Even in the centre of the shopping centre Baragoi you can be shot at night this happened before  The setting is one side of the trading centre is occupied by the Samburu the majority and the other the Turkana minority perceived to to immigrants from Turkana county years ago We are in Samburu County since the  constitution before it was Samburu District  The Samburu would claim that this is there ancestral land and the Turkana would use the gun and advance their agenda of acquiring more grazing land  this they have succeeded to some extent  the Samburu have long accepted this because the present Turkana generation in Baragoi is actually have birth right here and in the spirit of the  constitution also any Kenyan can live anywhere in Kenya wwwkenyalaworgexistkenyalexactviewxqlactidConst The government also lost about  police officers in the  incident in suguta valley They were in pursuit of cattle stolen from the Samburu people I wanted to go to court on the above issue and atleast sue the government and reguest them to compensate the poverty stricken people due to the loss of their livelihoods cows to the perennial attackers  No such thing has been done so far   I can extract all the families affected in the police OB with support of the community administration My question is  does this issue carry some weight to be listened by the courts The  Kenyan constitution is a near to perfect constitution borrowed from the developed countries and  one of the main work of the head of state in the constitution is to safeguard the peoples lives and property Am not a lawyer but i will get a probono lawyer I want to seek for compensation of loss of livelihoods The people in those manyatta have been reduced to just paupers

2280,law, Everything in Hollywoods historical movies is true right OK There are known counterexamples The recent film Loving is about the case in which Richard Loving and Mildred Jeter who resided in Caroline County Virginia married in the District of Columbia and resided in Virginia in violation of that states Racial Integrity Act of  which forbade marriage between a white person and a colored person apparently colored included everyone not considered white The defendants pled guilty and were sentenced to one year in prison and the sentence was suspended on condition that for  years they would never both be in the state of Virginia at the same time Several years later the ACLU took up their case As nearly as I understood the situation from the film Their lawyer Bernard Cohen asked the judge to change his mind and the judge stonewalled him for a while Since the deadline for appeal had passed and the case was closed nothing compelled the judge to answer or to do anything But then for some reason the judge wrote an opinion defending the statute He wrote that God put different races on different continents and that that showed he intended no mixing of races The judges opinion created a new opportunity for appeal Cohen then took the case to the highest court in Virginia and lost and then to the US Supreme Court So what I wondered is Why did the judge not just continue stonewalling Wikipedias article about the case says  On October   after waiting almost a year for a response to their motion the ACLU attorneys brought a class action suit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia This prompted the county court judge in the case Leon M Bazile to issue a ruling on the longpending motion to vacate  If the class action was in the film I missed it somehow So now my questions are  Am I right that the case that reached the US Supreme Court was the one from Caroline County and not the class action in federal court What became of the class action Did the class action in federal court somehow make the county judge decide to issue a ruling that he otherwise would not have had a reason to issue How does that work

2282,law, Immigration has been a big point of debate recently especially as it pertains to children I know accompanied children who are not legally allowed to enter the United States can be detained or deported if they are caught but my question is Are those children themselves determined to be committing an illegal act in the eyes of the law In other words are the children considered responsible for their illegal entry or are they seen as being brought into the country illegally by their parentsfamily This question is in reference to a firstoffense entry not the crime of reentry after deportation UPDATE After some more research it looks like the way unlawful presence is determined is different for children than adults but I still havent found any definitive answer to the question above though it seems to be yes

2284,law, First Im not asking about the actual open source license the situation is clear enough there It is about an additional component about patents It is about Facebooks open source project react but actually all their open source projects they all share that same patent text You can find license and patent clause here file names LICENSE and PATENTS httpsgithubcomfacebookreact  the important one being PATENTS This has already been discussed very thoroughly in many forums and blog posts for example  Your license to use Reactjs can be revoked if you compete with Facebook How do you deal with the React patent  licensing issue Why Im not a React Native Developer only the small part of the text under headline Patently daunting  I have read many of those discussions but I have two questions that were not answered there The first one ist just a confirmation of my understanding of a situation that the majority of those who posted in discussions dont face  Is my interpretation of how this may apply in my situation seems correct How does that compare to open source projects without a patent clause  To  less important just confirmation While the majority opinion seems to be it does not matter I think it does matter to some companies I for example work for a startup that relies on patents not on software itself but on methodsalgorithms like the MPEG patents If I interpret this correctly if we use any of Facebooks open source projects Facebook can violate our patents pretty much with impunity If we try to sue them we lose the right to patents covering their open source projects So basically we cannot use their stuff To  my main question I have read opinions that other open source projects that dont have such a clause for example those from Microsoft or Google nevertheless have the exact same problem only that it isnt explicitly stated Is that true Is my situation not any better when I only use open source projects without such a clause  EDIT A recent anecdote WordPress to ditch React library over Facebook patent clause risk I hadnt known that the patent clause  was recently added to the Apache Software Foundation’s ASF list of disallowed licenses Quite a few interesting links in that article too Another issue was raised in a comment If you use React in a product commercial or free and you lose permission because of a dispute how does that affect your users Will they have to stop using your product now too

2286,law, Im posting as a guest for anonymity  My exwife and I have a shared parenting plan  time of our  year old son We live in the US the state of Ohio and have been divorced technically a dissolution for around  years As our child is not yet school age we opted to put off assigning a custodial parent which I know is rapidly approaching  Since before we were divorced I have suspected my ex has a drinking problem but perhaps naively or more likely for lack of visibility I had thought she compartmentalized her drinking to her offparenting time Recently however there was an event that gave me great cause for concern and I want to be sure I understand the law so as not to mistep  Last weekend I was asked to watch my son for a few hours on a day that was scheduled hers he had been cooped up in the house sick and was apparently driving her nuts I took him out to run errands with me for a few hours but when it came time to drop him back off I received an alarming text message  Essentially she let me know that she had been drinking so it wasnt a good idea for her to meet us at the playground where we were going to be so instead could I drop him off directly at her house Obviously concerned I asked her how much she had drank to please stop and indicated I could keep him for an additional couple of hours while she took efforts to sober up She was understandably outraged claimed to have drank only  beers and demanded I drop him off immediately I held my ground and after a lot of arguing we eventually rescheduled the dropoff time to later in the day  One of the things she let slip verbally while we were arguing was that she apparently regularly drinks while she has him but never drives even after one beer and never gets drunk when he is around  Since this episode I have been reading up on denied visitation and the contempt charges that can spur from that and so I want to be very careful in how I act At the end of the day I want to protect my son but Im also scared that I could jeopardize my ability to gain primary or full custody of him I understand I need to document everything I see to begin building a case which I have started but I also want to be sure that if I have to involve the police that I do so in a way that doesnt harm my case My Questions  Is there a legal standard as to how sober a caregiver must be to safely watch a child or in other words how drunk does my ex have to be for me to deny a dropoff Is it entirely based upon outward signs or bloodalcohol level Am I correct in assuming that in order to protect myself from being accused of denying visitation that in the future I need to involve the police if I suspect her of being intoxicated  If I involve the police do I need to be sure that she is extremely intoxicated in order to avoid a false alarm  Obviously this scares me as Id prefer she didnt drink at all What options do I have if any if she drinks around him in her own home Is she within her legal right as long as she doesnt get in a car doesnt pass out or does something blatantly abusive

2290,law, Scope This topic is cousin to the latitude afforded journalists to protect their sources However this question primarily pertains to enforcement of the DMCA Definitions  “User” the entity that makes final use of copyrighted content who may or may not have a “Source” for the content “Source” the entity that acquires a copy of copyrighted content through whatever legal or illegal means “Owner” the entity that owns the copyright to the content in question  Exposition The Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA its exemptions and the fairuse clause of Title  Chapter  Section  of the US Code clearly provide methods by which an individual may use copyrighted material even if that material is protected by Digital Rights Management DRM It also appears that acquisition would be treated separately from fairuse considerations in a court of law due to the separation of civil and criminal cases in the united states However it is unclear under what circumstances an owner or government entity can question the origin of the content used and further to compel the user of said copyrighted content to disclose or prove the means of acquisition of the content or their source If owners and government entities were unable to do so this would imply that fairuse and protected activities provide immunity for DMCA violations in the absence of evidence of such a violation committed by the user However this would also be consistent with the presumption of innocence afforded by Coffin v United States  US    Some hypothetical examples Segments of a film are used for commentary or criticism but  The movie is still in theaters This can still be fair use but would clearly necessitate some form of illegal method of acquisition filming in a theater journalist’s source obtained digital copies from a premiere or festival provided that the individual has not received permission to use the content This might be a situation where probable cause is warranted The scenes used appear to be illegally obtained despite legal means existing The footage may appear to be filmed in a movie theater though a DVD is available and dvdripping might actually be a legally exempt means of acquiring the content The copyright owner merely suspects on a hunch that the user did not extract or obtain the content legally eg they didn’t dvdrip the content

2292,law, Immigration has been a big point of debate recently especially as it pertains to children I know accompanied children who are not legally allowed to enter the United States can be detained or deported if they are caught but my question is Are those children themselves determined to be committing an illegal act in the eyes of the law In other words are the children considered responsible for their illegal entry or are they seen as being brought into the country illegally by their parentsfamily This question is in reference to a firstoffense entry not the crime of reentry after deportation UPDATE After some more research it looks like the way unlawful presence is determined is different for children than adults but I still havent found any definitive answer to the question above though it seems to be yes

2295,law, For the past few day I am receiving emails in my gmail account from a travel company based in Belgium SEEEU asking for a payment of around  euros for a trip to Switzerland Initially I did not pay much attention as I thought they are spam emails But yesterday I received this email  We would like to inform you that despite our last two reminders to make the payment for this booking order you are not reacting or answering We will shortly send you a reminder by SMS and if we do not hear anything from you still we shall forward the file to our legal representative to start the legal proceedings for the recovery of the amount   interest  costs levied due to these proceedings As per the Belgian laws and as mentioned in our terms and conditions on the bookings page see below link we are obliged to warn the clients  times in writing and then we can start charging  interest from the day of third warning and start the proceedings of recovery Thank you for your kind notice of this and any response to our messages  The problem is that I never booked any such trip from their website The website never asked to activate my email or my consent before finalizing the booking They just sent an email notifying me that my trip has been booked which as I earlier said I ignored Now my question   I travel quite a lot including EU and Belgium and I am little worried Am I liable to pay them the money   Is it even legal to threat me for such payment At what point does it become cyber harassment It is quite possible that someone mistyped hisher email to mine If no is there someplace where I can report them

2442,math, The Continuum Hypothesis say that there is no set with cardinality between that of the reals and the natural numbers Apparently the Continuum Hypothesis cant be proved or disproved using the standard axioms of set theory  In order to disprove it one would only have to construct one counterexample of a set with cardinality between the naturals and the reals It was proven that the CH cant be disproven Equivalently it was proven that one cannot construct a counterexample for the CH Doesnt this prove it Of course the issue is that it was also proven that it cant be proved I dont know the details of this unprovability proof but how can it avoid a contradiction I understand the idea of something being independent of the axioms I just dont see how if there is provably no counterexample the hypothesis isnt immediately true since it basically just says a counterexample doesnt exist Im sure Im making some horrible logical error here but Im not sure what it is So my question is this what is the flaw in my argument Is it a logical error or a gross misunderstanding of the unprovability proof in question Or something else

2486,math, This is from Baby Rudin chapter  exercise  and Im using the unofficial answer key found here httpsmindswisconsineduhandle There is also this proof here Prove that bmn  bpq if r  mn  pq which I find unconvincing for reasons Ill explain The proof provided by the Wisconsin professor proceeds thus Let k  mq  np Because there is only one positive real number c such that cnq  bk to show that bmn and bpq have this property it follows that they are equal Thus bmnnq  bmq  bmq  bk and similarly for bpq My issue is in the computation specifically the first and second steps it seems like if I can distribute the exponents like this which is not a proved property the proof becomes trivial anyway because then bmn  bmn  bpq  bpq In the thread to which I linked above this issue is brought up and the OP proposes a proof by induction which includes the following steps xsk  xskxs xskxs xsks xsk But again this seems like its already using the fact that we can multiply exponents Am I missing something about this proof or is there a different way to go about this

2549,mathematica, Questions  What are the available resources to deal with experimental error and uncertainty propagation in Mathematica Given that Mathematica already uses linearized model of error propagation on ArbitraryPrecision Numbers Isnt that a all we need to track errors to first order  Case study I think this problem has broad scope but my particular interest in on experimental set of data that has large uncertainties therefore lower Precision than MachinePrecision Lets say my data looks similar to this  data  Table    PlusMinus     Sin ? t  RandomReal         t          t               ±        ±        ±        ±            ±      ±      I though it would make sense to express the data with error as something like datwerr  ReplaceAlldata PlusMinus  SetAccuracy LogAbs   It has been shown elsewhere that the precision of the result for simple operations can be predicted by a simple linear error propagation but then I find problems if I want to track the error of a Fourier transform   BTW Fourier does not take symbolic arguments and the documentation reads   If the elements of list are exact numbers Fourier begins by applying N to them   Can we trust the  error propagation if the Precision is well defined The procedure for which I would like to track the error propagation is roughly this  A time series data each point potentially with a different uncertainty based on the measurement error Rescale with some calibration constant also an Arbitraryprecision number based on the uncertainty of it Fourier transform Normalize by reference trace with equal treatment MinusLogRe and  Im  Except by the fact that Mathematica would not consider any Skewness of the error distribution to first order would the Accuracy of the result be a good estimation of the real error of the measurement if Accuracies of each data point were properly defined  Or am I missing some internal step on Mathematicas operation that would imply the calculation looses track of the uncertainties If the price to pay to track the error is that I need to do the Fourier by definition ie a sum of exponentials then I could do that Due diligence There is already a hint of the need for exploring the relationship floatingpoint numbers and error distributions and error propagation on this question on this answer and on the chat A package CovariancePropagation has been offered for the propagation of arbitrary covariance matrices dealing with correlated errors and so on But its not obvious how to apply this to more complicated data analysis on experimental data with error defined point by point There was a question that offering code for Error propagation but not a comparative review of the available tools for this task particularly comparing it with the Precision strategy It has been stated in this excellent answer that arbitrary precision numbers use a linearized model of error propagation

2584,mathoverflow, Let M be a topological nmanifold closed and connected not necessarily oriented When does M not admit up to homotopytype a CWstructure with a single ncell By classification of surfaces we assume n By existence of smooth structures we assume n In particular if M is smoothable then Morse theory provides us the desired structure Edit To put this question into context we have various ways of showing that HnM has either  or mathbbZ as its torsion subgroup depending on orientability One way when M is such a CWcomplex is to quickly look at the chaincomplex differential dCnMcongmathbbZto CnM and note that HnMcongmathbbZ for M orientable and HnMmathbbZcongmathbbZ otherwise So I would like to see how large of a class of manifolds this argument holds for Addendum After chatting with Allen Hatcher and Rob Kirby who reaffirm the comments below here are their resulting thoughts  We should be careful with the Kirby theorem of M being homotopyequivalent to a finite complex because this complex is obtained by first embedding M into mathbbRN and then wiggling the boundary of a tubular neighborhood Mtimes DNn of M to be PL and so the resulting complex could have icells with in  When dim Mne  there is a handlebodydecomposition and this can be arranged to have a single handle canceling the other handles with available handles  we can do this because there are no smoothing obstructions in a neighborhood of the skeleton Taking the dual handlebody we have a decomposition with a single nhandle Passing from the handlebodydecomposition to the CWdecomposition shrinking everything to their cores we obtain the desired CWcomplex with a single ncell  When dim M then a handlebodydecomposition exists if and only if M is smoothable So when M is smoothable we can apply the argument in   But even when M is not smooth we get some positive results in particular for the E manifold We build E using Kirby calculus on an link diagram giving a decomposition of E into a handle plus eight handles plus a contractible piece without the contractible piece we get a space with boundary being a homology sphere namely the Poincaresphere SG with G binary icosahedral group In particular flipping this structure over we see that E is homotopyequivalent to a CWcomplex with a single cell Furthermore Lennart Meiers remark gets us all other simplyconnected manifolds We are thus left with the scenario that M up to homotopy is a closed connected nonsimplyconnected nonsmoothable manifold which the comments below assert

2619,mathoverflow, It is a matter of mathematical folklore that Gödel entertained the idea of so called stronger axioms of infinity  deciding CH this quote from Radek Honziks paper Large cardinals and the Continuum Hypothesislook under title on the Web  Yet in both versions of his  paper What is Cantors continuum problem both in the  edition and the revised  edition he never mentioned the  paper of Banach and Kuratowski Sur une generalisation du probleme de la mesure found in Fundamenta Mathematicae   a downloadable version of which can be found in the Wikipedia entry Measurable cardinal  Jech in his text Set theory the third millennium edition has in              Chapter  Lemma  and Corollary  respectively their proof of the following theorem Corollary  of Jech  If there is a measure on aleph then aleph gt aleph  I find this omission very puzzling in light of the following result  ZFC  The cardinality of the continuum is a realvalued measurable cardinal is equiconsistent with ZFC  There exists a twovalued measurable cardinal  Though this is  hindsight it is interesting to note the SolovayJech result Theorem  ii of The third millenium edition  If kappa is a twovalued measurable cardinal then there exists a generic extension in which kappaaleph and kappa is realvalued measurable  for it shows that there is a model of ZFC for which   The cardinality of the continuum is a realvalued measurable cardinal  holds Furthermore  since the following results hold results courtesy of Joel David Hamkins from his answer to David Reids mathoverflow guestion a measurable cardinal  a realvalued measurable cardinal in the same model  Theorem  If there are two measurable cardinals then there is a forcing extension in which the smaller one becomes the continuum and realvalued measurable and the larger one remains measurable Proof  If kappa lt lambda are both measurable cardinals in V then the forcing to add kappa many random reals will make kappa into the continuum and still realvalued measurable by a result of Solovay and the larger measurable cardinal lambda remains measurable by the LevySolovay theorem because the forcing was much smaller than lambda  QED Corollary  The following are equiconsistent  There are two measurable cardinals There are two realvalued measurable cardinals There is a nonmeasurable realvalued measurable cardinal and a    measurable cardinal The continuum is realvalued measurable and there is another     measurable cardinal  Proof  Statement  implies  in a forcing extension by the argument above  Statement  implies statement  directly  Statement  implies statement  directly  Statement  implies statement  in an inner model  QED  The reason I am interested in this theorem and its corollary is that these give an indication of the relative size of the continuum as a realvalued measurable cardinal and the size of a twovalued measurable cardinal by Ulams dichotomy the cardinality of the continuum cannot be a twovalued measurable cardinal  Indeed under the forcing which adds kappa many random reals so that kappa is the cardinality of the continuum kappa can be considered a non twovalued measurable realvalued measurable cardinal or in another parlance an accessible weakly inaccessible cardinal because it is not strongly inaccessible Yet it is known that ZFC  The cardinality of the continuum is realvalued measurable implies that V neq L since the constructible reals under the existence of a realvalued measurable cardinal form a countable set so by one definition of large cardinal a cardinal is large  if ZFC  The cardinal exists proves V neq L realvalued measurable cardinals are large a definition Gödel I think would have approved of since in his paper both versions he writes  As for the continuum problem there is little hope of solving it by means of those axioms of infinity which can be set up on the basis of principles known today the abovementioned proof for the undisprovabiity of the continuum hypothesis eg goes through for all of them without any change  pg  pg  Another means of showing forth the largeness of realvalued cardinals is given by D H Fremlin in the introductory paragraph of Section  titled The enormity of realvaluedmeasurable cardinals from his preprint Realvalued measurable cardinals look under title on the Web  Under this title I collect together results of the form If kappa is realvaluedmeasurable there are many complex cardinals below it  Ulams theorem that a realvaluedmeasurable cardinal must be weakly inaccessible Dcd is the first step  if kappa is realvaluedmeasurable there are kappa cardinals below it  But enormously more can be said  To develop these ideas we need labels for some of the intermediate stages  First weakly Mahlo and greatly Mahlo cardinals A and then weakly Pinindescribable cardinals AC D  Up to the weakly Pi indescribable cardinals  we can use ordinary infinitary combinatorics AL but thereafter we shall need the apparatus of elementary model theory from section A and forcing from section   The culminating result is Theorem P  if kappa is realvaluedmeasurable there are many Piindescribable cardinals below it  The proof of this theorem includes essentially everything required to prove another remarkable fact  if kappa is atomlesslymeasurable and I any structure of cardinal less than kappa then the first and secondorder properties of I are unaffected by random real forcing Corollary Oa  The same arguments provide a general method for proving results of the form if kappa is realvaluedmeasurable there are many alpha lt kappa such that alpha vDash varphi  when we have found a proof that kappavDashvarphi for every realvaluedmeasurable cardinal kappa Ob  Given the above though  hindsight is there a reason Gödel never mentioned realvalued measurable cardinals or the BanachKuratowski theorem as a type of large cardinal which validated his thesis as it stands he could have placed this type of axiom in the other hitherto unknown axioms of set theory since realvalued measurability is defined  in terms of nontrivial probability measures on mathscr PX  Also is there any known correspondence in which Gödel explicitly mentions or discussed either the BanachKuratowski theorem or realvalued measurable cardinals           Thanks for any help given in this matter

2647,mathoverflow, It is a matter of mathematical folklore that Gödel entertained the idea of so called stronger axioms of infinity  deciding CH this quote from Radek Honziks paper Large cardinals and the Continuum Hypothesislook under title on the Web  Yet in both versions of his  paper What is Cantors continuum problem both in the  edition and the revised  edition he never mentioned the  paper of Banach and Kuratowski Sur une generalisation du probleme de la mesure found in Fundamenta Mathematicae   a downloadable version of which can be found in the Wikipedia entry Measurable cardinal  Jech in his text Set theory the third millennium edition has in              Chapter  Lemma  and Corollary  respectively their proof of the following theorem Corollary  of Jech  If there is a measure on aleph then aleph gt aleph  I find this omission very puzzling in light of the following result  ZFC  The cardinality of the continuum is a realvalued measurable cardinal is equiconsistent with ZFC  There exists a twovalued measurable cardinal  Though this is  hindsight it is interesting to note the SolovayJech result Theorem  ii of The third millenium edition  If kappa is a twovalued measurable cardinal then there exists a generic extension in which kappaaleph and kappa is realvalued measurable  for it shows that there is a model of ZFC for which   The cardinality of the continuum is a realvalued measurable cardinal  holds Furthermore  since the following results hold results courtesy of Joel David Hamkins from his answer to David Reids mathoverflow guestion a measurable cardinal  a realvalued measurable cardinal in the same model  Theorem  If there are two measurable cardinals then there is a forcing extension in which the smaller one becomes the continuum and realvalued measurable and the larger one remains measurable Proof  If kappa lt lambda are both measurable cardinals in V then the forcing to add kappa many random reals will make kappa into the continuum and still realvalued measurable by a result of Solovay and the larger measurable cardinal lambda remains measurable by the LevySolovay theorem because the forcing was much smaller than lambda  QED Corollary  The following are equiconsistent  There are two measurable cardinals There are two realvalued measurable cardinals There is a nonmeasurable realvalued measurable cardinal and a    measurable cardinal The continuum is realvalued measurable and there is another     measurable cardinal  Proof  Statement  implies  in a forcing extension by the argument above  Statement  implies statement  directly  Statement  implies statement  directly  Statement  implies statement  in an inner model  QED  The reason I am interested in this theorem and its corollary is that these give an indication of the relative size of the continuum as a realvalued measurable cardinal and the size of a twovalued measurable cardinal by Ulams dichotomy the cardinality of the continuum cannot be a twovalued measurable cardinal  Indeed under the forcing which adds kappa many random reals so that kappa is the cardinality of the continuum kappa can be considered a non twovalued measurable realvalued measurable cardinal or in another parlance an accessible weakly inaccessible cardinal because it is not strongly inaccessible Yet it is known that ZFC  The cardinality of the continuum is realvalued measurable implies that V neq L since the constructible reals under the existence of a realvalued measurable cardinal form a countable set so by one definition of large cardinal a cardinal is large  if ZFC  The cardinal exists proves V neq L realvalued measurable cardinals are large a definition Gödel I think would have approved of since in his paper both versions he writes  As for the continuum problem there is little hope of solving it by means of those axioms of infinity which can be set up on the basis of principles known today the abovementioned proof for the undisprovabiity of the continuum hypothesis eg goes through for all of them without any change  pg  pg  Another means of showing forth the largeness of realvalued cardinals is given by D H Fremlin in the introductory paragraph of Section  titled The enormity of realvaluedmeasurable cardinals from his preprint Realvalued measurable cardinals look under title on the Web  Under this title I collect together results of the form If kappa is realvaluedmeasurable there are many complex cardinals below it  Ulams theorem that a realvaluedmeasurable cardinal must be weakly inaccessible Dcd is the first step  if kappa is realvaluedmeasurable there are kappa cardinals below it  But enormously more can be said  To develop these ideas we need labels for some of the intermediate stages  First weakly Mahlo and greatly Mahlo cardinals A and then weakly Pinindescribable cardinals AC D  Up to the weakly Pi indescribable cardinals  we can use ordinary infinitary combinatorics AL but thereafter we shall need the apparatus of elementary model theory from section A and forcing from section   The culminating result is Theorem P  if kappa is realvaluedmeasurable there are many Piindescribable cardinals below it  The proof of this theorem includes essentially everything required to prove another remarkable fact  if kappa is atomlesslymeasurable and I any structure of cardinal less than kappa then the first and secondorder properties of I are unaffected by random real forcing Corollary Oa  The same arguments provide a general method for proving results of the form if kappa is realvaluedmeasurable there are many alpha lt kappa such that alpha vDash varphi  when we have found a proof that kappavDashvarphi for every realvaluedmeasurable cardinal kappa Ob  Given the above though  hindsight is there a reason Gödel never mentioned realvalued measurable cardinals or the BanachKuratowski theorem as a type of large cardinal which validated his thesis as it stands he could have placed this type of axiom in the other hitherto unknown axioms of set theory since realvalued measurability is defined  in terms of nontrivial probability measures on mathscr PX  Also is there any known correspondence in which Gödel explicitly mentions or discussed either the BanachKuratowski theorem or realvalued measurable cardinals           Thanks for any help given in this matter

2672,money, I currently owe  in student loans  principal   unpaid interest accrued so far with an average interest rate of  I just started working full time  GAI and I can now start making payments  Id like to figure out the best way to pay off loans as early as possible without completely depleting my income so Ive come up with the following table figures are based on this website httpstudentloanherocomcalculatorsstudentloanprepaymentcalculator  Yrs Monthly Payment  Interest Saved  Ratio                                                                                                                                                                                         The first two columns give the time frame in years in which all loans would be paid off using the given monthly payment amount The third column gives the amount of interest saved compared to choosing the standard year repayment plan The last column gives the ratio of Interest Saved  Monthly Payment My interpretation of the ratio column is that a higher ratio combines the best total interest savings amount with the lowest monthly repayment amount In other words I could choose to pay  each month about  of my takehome pay each month for  years and maximize interest savingsor I could pay  per month about  of my takehome pay for  years which loses me  in total but gives me a much healthier budget for other things each month  So  Do these figures look reasonably correct Am I overcomplicating this Should I go with the year plan I described or try to pay as high a monthly payment as I can realistically afford each month

2674,money, According to the answers on Can a merchant charge you more in the US if you want to use a credit card I gather that while it is not illegal for a merchant to pass their payment card processing fees on to their customers directly in the form of a surcharge doing so is a violation of their merchant agreements with the payment card processor at least for VisaMC There are workarounds available to the merchants such as offering a cash discount or setting a minimum purchase amount for cards but if the merchant is not using such a workaround in my experience many dont whats the best way to get them to process my transaction without applying the fee or alternatively penalize them for applying the fee  JoeTaxpayer helpfully points out that merchants can now impose a surcharge in most states subject to certain conditions including signage at both point of entry and point of sale This question is asked in the context of a merchant that fails to comply with these or other applicable requirements Please also note that Dont patronize those merchants isnt the kind of answer Im looking for here If the merchant were properly complying with all of the conditions under which they can impose a surcharge that would be the only recourse but I am interested in answers for the specific case of a noncompliant merchant  Here are two actual examples from my personal experience In neither of these cases was I successful in either compelling the merchant to complete the transaction without imposing the surcharge or in causing a direct repercussion to the merchant sufficient to induce them to discontinue the practice  A local pizza place would add an additional  charge for purchases made by credit card I was aware of this practice and I had also read that Visa and MasterCard both prohibit it When I went in to pick up my pizza they asked if it would be cash or credit Before answering I asked Whats the total They quoted me an amount equal to the menu price plus sales tax if I paid cash and stated that if I used a credit card it would be an extra  cents I told the cashier that this was not allowed but the cashier indicated it was not up to them They stated that most of their customers just paid in cash They were busy I was hungry and I had no cash on me so rather than continue to press the issue I asked the cashier to be sure that my receipt clearly distinguishes the amount of the fee and identifies it as a surcharge specifically imposed because I paid with my card She handwrote CC next to the  cent line item and I left with my food and put the receipt somewhere so it wouldnt get lost telling myself that I would contact Visa about it I never did and I lost the receipt anyway    I stopped at a convenience store on my way to the disc golf course to buy two bottles of Gatorade The cashier I think he was also the owner scanned them and read me the total I held out my credit card and he said Oh theres a  cent fee with that I replied No I do not agree to that He stated that the store incurs a cost every time they process a credit card transaction and something about margins I responded along the lines of I dont really care what your margins are Those fees are a cost of doing business and Visa and MasterCard both explicitly prohibit you from charging me extra to use my card However he did not change his position I left the bottles on the counter and walked across the street to his competitor and as far as I know he still charges that fee

2876,music, Ive been using Guitar Rig  for a year or two and its a fairly useful toy for a bedroom guitarist Currently I use a Behringer UCG USB interface which has a guitar in and headphone out  When connected to my computer it works fine I get the modified audio via the headphone out However if I want to listen to practice materials media on my laptop for example and play along I have to jump through a few more hoops my current setup is to use a  lead from the headphone out to my amp use a mm cable from the headphone port on the laptop to the same port on my amp and then plug headphones in my amp This way I can get both my guitar audio and computer audio at the same time Its convoluted but provided I have an amp it works  However Im away from home at the moment and dont have access to my amplifier though I have a guitar and USB interface along with GR software I cant seem to configure the ASIOALL drivers in such a fashion that I get the normal laptop output via the USB interface without cutting off the output from Guitar Rig Can anyone advise me on a way to have the two working simultaneously

2878,music, It seems that electric guitars and possibly also acoustic steelstring have narrower necks than nylonstring ones The strings are more close together not sure whether this is the cause or a consequence Why is this so Are there many exceptions from this rule  Here are some guesses  Require less finger movement to make fretting more precise Make it possible to use the thumb for fretting Tradition no rational explanation Make it possible to bend several strings at once  Nothing here seems convincing enough 
2879,music, Something that woke me up in the middle of the night realising that if you take the  notes in an octave in western music and from that you remove all those belonging to a major scale you are left with  notes arranged as a pentatonic scale the mode of the  note scale or the minormajor quality of the pentatonic is irrelevant here How come in twenty years of playing guitar Ive never come across this fact Not that is useful or is it but even now doing a few Internet searches I cant find any reference to this For example take C major all white keys in piano You are left with Eb Gb Ab Bb Db all black keys in piano which is an Eb minor pentatonic  Im not very good with music theory so maybe this is obvious to anyone that goes to music school I just found very interesting that these two patterns that are by far the most commonly used more than any melodic harmonic or other exotic scale arrangements always within western music and their notes are arranged so that they add up to all twelve notes in the octave without overlapping Two questions Is this just a coincidence Is there a musical way to use this And if someone could point out to any website where this is mentioned Id be curious to know

2916,music, As a mediocre guitarist just starting to dabble with other instruments the first several fingering diagrams for flutes saxophones etc make good intuitive sense to me because youre effectively just lengthening or shortening the resonance cavity and coming from strings its pretty easy to grasp that shorthigh and longlow After the first several notes however that intuition begins to break down and I really dont understand whats going on Take this fingering chart for example  D through B make total sense to me but I dont understand how the subsequent brokenlooking patterns work AT ALL I can see how leaving the first tone hole uncovered will produce a higher pitch but I dont understand how any open fingering after the first open fingering actually changes the note If my original intuitions about DB are correct it seems like the first open hole the wave encounters should be the only one that matters Are you setting up two regions of resonance that interfere with one another Can this be thought of like harmonics on a string instrument What does a single open fingering in the middle C or that high E actually DO Is there an intuitive way to wrap my brain around this or am I just going to have to memorize diagrams

2921,music, As a nonprofessional intermediatelevel guitarist interested in playing jazz I wonder how important it is for me to be able to sight read music and I mean standard music notation not guitar tablature etc in order to take it to the next level While I can certainly think of many situations where reading may be requiredhelpful eg some gigs recording sessions etc I also suspect that there are many highly skilled guitarists that do not know how to read I assume that it certainly wouldnt hurt to have this skill but Im not convinced that its worth the significant investment  My current thinking is that it is more important to spend that time practicing in other ways eg learning many scales chord voicings existing songs working on rhythm etc  However Im worried that I may be making a mistake Will not learning to sight read make it significantly more difficult for me to become a competent jazz guitarist in the long run  Update Thanks for all the awesome feedback  I think there are a few takeaway points from the answers please correct me if I didnt interpret them correctly  Theres a difference between being able to read in real time eg good enough to work from a sheet Im not familiar with at a gig and being proficient enough to read in less demanding situations eg Im learning new songsmelodies on my own time The amount of skill necessary depends on the type of gigs one wants to play eg required for big band not necessary for small tets because they work more from improv over the standards  I should have been clear that Im more interested in informally playing in tets but regardless all the answers are really helpful  I think that what Im going to do is try to invest a small amount of time to be able to read well enough to figure out new melodiessongs when Im on my own but I probably wont be investing the significant amount of time necessary to read and play unfamiliar music in real time

2940,outdoors, I acquired a JanSport external frame backpack in the early s from a thrift store  it was used I recently hiked a few sections of the Colorado Trail and said backpack attracted lots of interest since it was so old  I got several questions about it but was unable to provide much information Here are some pics of a backpack found online that is about the same model as mine my backpack is considerably more beat up than the one pictured and has a straight vice curved uppermost crossbar      Can anyone provide the model name and year of this backpack Ive asked JanSport Customer Service about this  While they were very helpful and even shipped a part I needed for the backpack theyve been unable to correctly identify the backpack  They guessed that it was a Cascade model from the early s  They scanned a page from a  JanSport catalog and sent it to me  As you can clearly see my backpack is not one of the three pictured on said scanned catalog page  Of the three backpacks pictured on said page mine is closest in appearance to the one on the left as that one has a straight uppermost crossbar  It is interesting to note that of the two Cascade models depicted the two leftmost backpacks pictured on said catalog page the one for the larger torso has a straight vice curved uppermost crossbar One wonders if that would be true for my backpack as well

2980,outdoors, One thing I need to do to prepare for deer season is to sight in my rifle Im new to the Boise area and dont know where I should go Id prefer to go to somewhere free but if the only options available are paid ranges Ill do that In talking to nonsportsmen they recommended driving out into the desert south of town While I know it is legal to shoot on many types of public land Id like something more concrete than a hand wave in a general direction For example where I grew up there was one shooting area on public land that was very well known and used So well known and used that it is even marked on Google Maps as Keswick Dam Shooting Area There was another area that was known and used but saw substantially less traffic because you had to walk a short ways in Out of the tens of thousands of acres of public land in the area where it was legal to shoot these two spots were the places where everyone went to shoot Im looking for a similar situation in the Boise area  The main reason why I want to stick to the known shooting areas is I want to avoid having arguments with well intentioned random passerbys if what Im doing is legal or not Sticking to known shooting areas avoids this hassle Also some areas are better than other areas When these areas are on public land they end up seeing more shooters over time until they become known as the local shooting spot Id rather not reinvent the wheel and go to a known good area Finally if I can drive directly to a known good spot I will save time If all I have is directions to a thousand acres of BLM land I have to search a thousand acres for a good backstop far enough away with protection from the wind along the shooting corridor and low probability that peopleanimals will wander into my line of fire Known shooting spots will have solved these problems and allow me to drive directly to that spot

2989,outdoors, I had to tie down a tree last night since recent storms broke the guy lines I had placed when I planted it and I used a tautline knot howto I found online to tie it since I was never a Scout After reading a comment by KRyan on a recent question and considering my recent facetoface with my inexperience I started lamenting the fact that I was never a Scout Which got me thinking is there an organization similar to the Boy Scouts for adults who want to learn outdoorsmanship  Edit My country of residence is the United States Also googling led me to NOLS but that seems to be a lot more intense with semesterlong courses and student loans and college credit Im really just looking for a weekend scouting club where I can learn how to survive and thrive outdoors  Edit  I know some have suggested the military in jest but others have done so more seriously I have several reasons for not joining the military but my main one is I have a family and I dont want to be away from them That said Im very interested in options where both I and my daughter can participate together As for the BoyGirl Scouts were atheist and would prefer something without a religious component Hence the OP 
2990,outdoors, I was having a debate with my friend on the definition of Sport Climbing We both agree it means rock climbing with no presetup ropes on a bolted route  I think regardless of whether this route is in an indoor gym or at a real rock outdoors its all called sport climbing However my friend thinks its only called sport climbing if its at a real rock outdoors He called it indoor lead climbing if its in an indoor gym But I think lead climbing has a broader meaning it includes both sport climbing and trad climbing and its also mentioned in this question  Whats the difference between Sport Climbing and Traditional Climbing Am I correct

2994,outdoors, Having watched several Bear Grylls shows I was curious if anyone has any practical uses for a commando rappel as he calls it or an Australian rappel It seems like theyre only used for entertainment since Ive never seen anyone do one outside of television On the other hand their name suggests an origin in military training perhaps so one could shoot down while rappelling It was briefly mentioned here as being dangerous Are there any practical uses for a commando rappel or is it simply unnecessary and dangerous 
2995,outdoors, Growing up we had an old aluminum canoe It looked kind of ugly and had some dents but it was a great boat Over the past  years Ive been in various sporting goods stores in California Colorado and Idaho looking at canoes Every single canoe they have on display is plastic They never have aluminum canoes Aluminum canoes that Ive found on the internet are price competitive generally slightly cheaper and weigh less than the plastic canoes  My own biased perception is the aluminum canoes are more durable hardier in and out of the water since they cant warp if stored in the sun require less maintenance and if they are damaged are easier to fix I know that Im biased so I dont understand why the market seems to be dominated by plastic canoes What am I missing Why are plastic canoes everywhere and aluminum canoes hard to find Is there something in the procon list between the respective build materials that makes plastic canoes a clear winner

2998,outdoors, A few years ago I er… a friend of mine put up a rope swing in a nearby park Its in a large eucalyptus about  metres high and is much loved by many local kids – and parents  Originaly I just used super cheap polypropylene rope I think it was polypropylene it was that cheap hard twisted stuff sold in hardware stores for general utility with an eye splice forming a slipknot around the branch The splice has held up well but the rope started to deteriorate to the point where it is fraying so I had to cut it down  Since then Ive been seeing kids and parents turn up to the swing tree look up at the cutoff end of the rope and walk away in disappointment And its Summer holiday time here so I need to replace it  So can anyone recommend what sort for rope I should use Selection criteria are     Durability  Its out in the weather all day long Winter mild never freezes and Summer can be blazing hot Enough strength to support an adult swinging from it and lastly  affordability  While it doesnt have to be super cheap it could get cut down by the council or some grump I did have a problem with it getting cut off at head height by some unknown person for a while theres a few grumpy old Boo Radleys around so Im not going to use proper climbing rope or anything   Also any suggestions for better ways to attach it to the branch would be good Im thinking this time of having a stopper knot below the loop so that it doesnt cinch on the branch and maybe adding a sleeve of some flexible tubing to avoid rubbing on the tree

3004,outdoors, Several years ago I purchased an Exped down filled inflatable sleeping pad It is a more comfortable pad than Thermarest pads Ive used in the past so I would still recommend it That being said when I purchased the pad I remember Exped making a big deal about how their pads are filled with down as if this was a major improvement in terms of warmth and possibly comfort over other sleeping pads At the time I bought this marketing pitch hook line and sinker   However I was laying in my tent during a recent camping trip and I started to think about what possible benefit down really offers inside of an inflatable sleeping pad As far as I know down is warm because it does a good job of trapping air and it is light weight How would trapping air be helpful in an inflatable sleeping pad The air is already trapped or the pad would deflate Downs other claim to fame is being light weight I dont know how that applies to a sleeping pad since not filling it with down would be lighter than filling it with down Also getting down wet is a known problem and so Exped recommends that I fill my sleeping pad using the pads stuff sack as an air pump so the moisture from my breath doesnt foul the down inside the pad That leads to a bulky specialized stuff sack that I didnt need for other sleeping pads Another mild annoyance is there are two valves on theh pad so that down doesnt collect on one side of the pad This makes deflating quicker but it doubles the chance a valve will fail thus ruining my pad The more I thought about it the more convinced I became that the increased warmth and comfort of my Exped pad was due to its substantially increased thickness vs Thermarest pads Does filling a sleeping pad offer any real benefit or is it just a marketing gimmick that exploits foolish people like myself who blindly accept down makes everything better

3024,outdoors, Any ideas what bird is making this song  Unfortunately this photo was the best I got but I did get a lot of audio of its call the YouTube video has a bunch of them clipped together At the end of the video you can see one of the birds same kind as the one singing fly away  In case its flight gives any hints It sounds like it has at least two maybe three distinct calls The one call you can hear over and over and was the majority of its calls  But it also had one where it had  or  superquick chirps followed by a highlow highlow specific spot in video linked here Im in Northwest Ohio US if that helps narrow it down Video YouTube video with song of unknown bird Photo  Rough Sketch Update I saw it today through binoculars but still couldnt get close enough  for long enough I did see that it had some spots or lines on its stomach similar to a young bird but it appears to be an adult  It was lighter brown than I was led to believe from the videos when it was silhouetted last night It had a dark marking from its eye like a racoon and white over its eye  It is roughly  to  smaller than the robins we have around here which are probably American Robins as described on this page from the Ohio Division of Wildlife It appeared to be the size of a chickadee but with a longer tail Larger than a gold finch  The only times Ive seen this bird it was on the very top of a pine tree like in the video Ive not seen it on the ground at all There was a bird here last year that I never saw that was making a very unique sound Not sure if it was this kind or not as I wasnt able to find it and dont remember the song Todays look was quick and I tried to remember as best I could but again it was from a distance so the rough sketch below might not be super accurate  The first time I saw it today I thought it may have had some orange tint on its stomach but didnt see it the second time  UPDATE  After much googling it looks very similar to a female rose breasted grosbeak if not exactly alike  I cant find a song that matches though so I cant verify if thats what it is

3027,parenting, TLDR  Is there a valid argument for not giving a child a presentreward daily or am I thinking to hard about this and it is perfectly fine to give a child a daily presentreward  So my daughter recently has really gotten into Pokemon cards and she just turned four a week ago The other day I picked up a small  pack of her first cards and she was beyond happy The entire way home she was even examining every detail of the pack and completely zoned out Anyways I am trying to decide the best option to give her more There are some Ebay lots that I am thinking of bidding on to get a good deal on some old used cards for her Some have upwards of  cards and are going for like  or so Given that she does not really know how to play the game at this point or anything I feel like this would be a way to give her a new card every day after she correctly writes her daily alphabet letter does something without me asking etc On the other hand however I am also thinking that buying and giving her such a large or constant reward might dull the effect Im also worried that it might get her into the mindset that she deserves something everyday I would appreciate any thoughts from anyone that has been in this type of a situation and made the wrong choice or knows a reason why i should or should not be so worried etc Any ideas on different approaches to giving them to her Thank you for any advice 
3028,parenting, My  year old daughters is usually very good  But in the last few months she has started to cry more and more each time she cant have something she wants The odd thing is that its something she didnt really used to do before well not as often anyway As far as I can think nothing major changed in her life recently that could trigger this change of behaviour Were currently trying to encourage her to stop crying for anything by giving her stars  stars   small present but I dont think its making any difference Any tip much appreciated 
3029,parenting, I want to start out saying that I realize there is nothing unusual about my sons behavior as Im about to describe especially considering the situation new baby I am just wondering what if anything can be done to help him out My son the oldest is just a couple of weeks shy of his third birthday  Two months ago my wife gave birth to his younger sister  There are just the two kids Since shortly after the younger sister was born and especially since we no longer had grandparents visiting to see the new baby we live far enough away that we do not see grandparents except a couple of times per year the behavior of my son has changed noticeably  When things dont go the way he wants he resorts instantly to whining which builds up sometimes also instantly to an epic crying fit  When he starts whining it is nearly impossible to reason with him or get him to listen to us and when hes throwing a fit its basically impossible to get him to calm down and listen for at least a little bit  He threw large fits before his younger sister was born but nothing like what he does now nor as often its several times a day now These whine sessionsfits are thrown when something happens that he doesnt want like time to turn off the TV or time to stop playing outside when we cant understand what hes saying or even for small things  Often the fits over smaller things are easily resolved by us but hes so inconsolable he wont pay enough attention for us to resolve his problem After throwing a fit for a while we can usually convince him to calm down and he is able to calm himself down fairly quickly  However it takes a while to get to that point Again I know this behavior isnt unusual  I am not expecting to eliminate fits or whine sessions from my son but I am hoping I can teach him to express displeasure in a reasonable way for at least a few seconds before starting whining and throwing fits so those things that are easily resolvable can be resolved before he gets to the point that he wont pay attention to what were saying any more 
3030,parenting, I have two sons  and  years old My older boy is very shy and extremely silent When we are with other people he never speaks with anybody he talks only to me and never pays attention to others He has absolutely the same behavior with his father When I leave the room where the three of us are he leaves too They never speak to each other If his father asks him something he answers only yes or no  My husband think that he could not do anything to change the situation and doesnt even try The boy realize that the relationship with his father is not OK   I will appreciate any advice

3036,parenting, My son is  and in second grade  In general he is quite healthy but he has illness induced asthma  In other words his asthma is essentially dormant unless he gets a cold or the flu at which point it can become quite severe This morning he has a cough and a cold and my wife and I decided he was well enough to go to school  I would like to email the teacher to explain the situation and ask her to keep an eye on him sending him to the nurse or the office if his breathing appears labored or he appears to get more under the weather I dont know if this is appropriate and if it is or if it isnt are there any guidelines about what I should and shouldnt ask of my childs teacher Shes a great teacher and Im fairly sure she would agree to whatever I asked but I want to be respectful of her existing requirements and challenges while also honoring my responsibility as a parent TLDR  What is okay to ask of from my childs teacher regarding his physical health 
3037,parenting, As a relatively newly single parent I have been contemplating the idea of when I am dating someone when to introduce them to my child  year old  Currently I have just kept those lives separate as things have not ever progressed past a few dates but there will be a point in time when I am dating someone more seriously Does any one have any research around this subject they could share Specifically when is the right time to introduce a kid to someone you are dating in either a more casual or serious type relationship I want to put my child as my number one priority so I want to do whatever is best in that regard as to not cause confusion or mess with their mental state 
3039,parenting, One of my daughters is still begging for her stroller despite me attempting to wean her off of it I occasionally allow it for long outings that could be a little tiring for her little feet but on the whole I dont allow her to use it anymore I personally think  year olds should be almost stroller free even on long outings  but cant bring myself to deny her it on long days What are your thoughts 
3040,parenting, We have friends who need help finding a stroller that can hold a newborn and a yearold at the same time    We found the Phil and Ted Navigator and dot which seem to have endless setup options with the bassonet addon but I cant seems to see any that allow for a newborn to lie flat with a toddler on board toddler sitting not on a clip on scooter or the like   Does anyone know if those models can do that  If not are there other stackerstyle ones that can They cant use a sidebyside like the bugaboo donkey for some reason

3058,parenting, For a while my  Year old son has been a bit of a Daddys Boy and we have had a similar experience to this question However its gotten worse lately  He cries with his mum for long periods while I am at work Doesnt like me to put him down he cries and clings onto my shirtclothes Much worse at eating his food even when I feed him   With the food sometimes the only thing that works is to put food in front of him and ignore him he cries for a bit and then starts to eat when he figures we arent looking I hate doing this but its better then him not eating As a weird coincidence when I make the food as apposed to his mum he seems to prefer but I cant imagine he notices I think this is just a false correlation we are spotting Whenever we ask a healthcare professional the answer is babies cry but I am worried my wife cant take much more of this constant lack of affection  crying Are these symptoms of separation anxiety Or is it a teething phase which partly explains the food Or a mixture of both Does anyone have any advice for this situation

3073,parenting, My stepson is a sixyearold native Japanese speaker When my wife and I first met and as we started getting more serious in our relationship we didnt put a whole lot of effort into attempting to teach him English Every time the topic was broached he was very adamant about not learning it  At the same time we got married I also legally adopted him If there came a point where my wife his mother who speaks Japanese and English was unable to be with us for a long period of time and I needed to convey something to him that was important I would most likely need to do it English  I am already actively learning Japanese I take regular certification tests to note improvements and while I am a little more than conversational I am still not quite there yet With what I am about to ask please keep in mind I will continue to learn Japanese  We have discussed this and my wife and I believe it is time that he does indeed begin to learn English The kindergarten he goes to is already an English speaking school and he takes an hour long English program every couple of days at the same school On top of that I would also like to teach him at home starting with the alphabet  I informed him that I would begin teaching him next week and he was not so thrilled about that idea This is not a debatable matter Our parents had us go to school to learn about math and science and then when we got home taught us how to clean our rooms brush our teeth and make our beds all these things were a necessity We both believe this is a necessity not an extracurricular The question is how do I coax my son to learn English while making him a willing participant I dont want to go the route my parents or so many other parents take when encouraging children to do better in school by grounding them or taking things away This will only push him further away from wanting to learn  At the moment he watches a lot of TV Probably too much but thats a separate issue I was thinking of starting during the time that he watches TV If I take this time away though he will be mad and discouraged from studying with me If I dont take the time away though we wont have very much other time to study by the time I get home hes already home Does anyone have any thoughts

3080,parenting, Im currently  years old and Im in my last year at the highschoolyear  I live in germany with my parents Since I can remember my parents made me want to have success They taught me reading since I was four which provided me big advantages in primary school I was entered in primary school early and skipped the first class I must have been very talented in maths and logical thinking which finally resulted in me coming to the Gymnasium its the only middle school type where you can dircetly get the right to study kinda the best Until there everything was fine It was in  when I came to the new school There was no big problem about that at least for the first half year Then my father started to really push me to work He forced me to at least work for two hours every day unimportant which plans I had for a day I wasnt able to just say no that I didnt want thatadditionaly at this point I believed all that my parents told me My grades were extremely good at this time in the english grade system it would have been something very close to an Aonly average It went on like that for about a year when my grandparents were shocked what I old them about my learning pensumI didnt see them often my father and they had a dispute and we children had to suffer under it I saw them twice a year if I was lucky They tried to convince my father to give me some more freedom which resulted in a complete destuction of their relationship To the present day they have never taked with each other again My father was the opinion that grandparents should totally keep away of the upbringing of his children We werent allowed to see them more than once a year and even that was only because I was old enough to understand why we werent allowed to see them more often This was the first time when I started to question the system of successa name my parents invented My father raised my learning time to three hours a day made me start a sport which I dont really approve and entered me in guitar lessons To be fair I really enjoyed the guitar and have already won diverse competions He always said I would be allowed to stop doing the sport when I would reach a certain grade but that was a LIE I reached it four years ago and still have to go to the training He said he would force me to continue doing it as long as he could This went on for four years when I had the possibility to flee from all this pressure for half a year I was really glad my french teacher supported me to make an exchange program  that ook half a year in France I was so glad to finally be free from my parents always standing behind me Although I reduced my learning time to one hour per day my grades kept extremely goodMy french teacher in France told me that I had beaten nearly the whole class in a BIG homework about classic literature This was the second time I really doubted the need of the really intense learning all the time Back to germany I was completely overran by my father wanting me to return to the old rule of the three hours I was  at the time and this time I had the strengh to argue with him in a actual position and with arguments why the intense learning was uneffective Since then we only had temporary peaces at home My mother fleed from this stress and decided that she would want to have nothing to do with all this learning stuff My father mde me enter my math studies early program in the local university to give to very good scholars the possibility to enter their studies early I succeded in this as well I already have completed the first regular semester without ever have seen the univerity  Since  months I have a job as a programmer in the Fraunhofer Institute which I took to have two afternoons in the week to do what I enjoy working on programing on a high level I started this very early in a school project and always kept interested My father has continously raised the amount of time he wants me to learn in a week Now he is at  hoursweek which is insanlely much This means that I spend the ENTIRE weekends on learning doing nothing else the whole day I have stopped arguing against him but now I cant stand the pressure anymore He threatens to throw me out of the house if I dont do what he says I have already started my plans to move out at the day I get  but that is still almost a year away How can I make him clear that I rather have little bit less good grades but living more strightened out without him making me leave the house I completely think he would do that  EDIT I have not been able to write down every detail but if you have any questions please feel free to ask

3107,parenting, How do I teach my  years old and  years old daughters about nutritious foods proper nutrition and balanced diet Actually I understand about them very basic and I am not quite sure that I can explain and persuade my children to have sufficient nutrition daily  I am thinking of using food toys and pictures to educate them about nutrition but I do not know it could be good and interesting idea for them to learn   
3110,parenting, I want to start out saying that I realize there is nothing unusual about my sons behavior as Im about to describe especially considering the situation new baby I am just wondering what if anything can be done to help him out My son the oldest is just a couple of weeks shy of his third birthday  Two months ago my wife gave birth to his younger sister  There are just the two kids Since shortly after the younger sister was born and especially since we no longer had grandparents visiting to see the new baby we live far enough away that we do not see grandparents except a couple of times per year the behavior of my son has changed noticeably  When things dont go the way he wants he resorts instantly to whining which builds up sometimes also instantly to an epic crying fit  When he starts whining it is nearly impossible to reason with him or get him to listen to us and when hes throwing a fit its basically impossible to get him to calm down and listen for at least a little bit  He threw large fits before his younger sister was born but nothing like what he does now nor as often its several times a day now These whine sessionsfits are thrown when something happens that he doesnt want like time to turn off the TV or time to stop playing outside when we cant understand what hes saying or even for small things  Often the fits over smaller things are easily resolved by us but hes so inconsolable he wont pay enough attention for us to resolve his problem After throwing a fit for a while we can usually convince him to calm down and he is able to calm himself down fairly quickly  However it takes a while to get to that point Again I know this behavior isnt unusual  I am not expecting to eliminate fits or whine sessions from my son but I am hoping I can teach him to express displeasure in a reasonable way for at least a few seconds before starting whining and throwing fits so those things that are easily resolvable can be resolved before he gets to the point that he wont pay attention to what were saying any more

3113,parenting, I have an  year old son who refuses to use the restroom He does  in toilet but not  This has been going on for less than a year Id say about  months now Before that his potty routine was normal Out of nowhere he started refusing to go Ive asked him if theres any reason to why he doesnt use the toilet and he responds with I dont know theres no reason  He stays with his grandfather every weekend and he does it there as well He doesnt do it at school at all I guess he waits till hes at home where hes most comfortable because he doesnt want kids to smell him  What can I do to make him use the restroom like he used to Im tired of having to wash his underwear as often as I do and having talks with him about the need of toilets

3115,physics, I understand that particles interact via the fundamentals forces of nature For example photons interact with matter because they carry the change in the electromagnetic field Neutrinos on the other hand do not interact with the electromagnetic field and so go through matter with almost no interaction However neutrinos still have a size and a mass so can a neutrino hit an electron which also has a size though unlikely that is Since neutrinos do not interact with the electromagnetic field they would not be deflected so can two particles like a neutrino and an electron hit headon 
3116,physics, I was wondering if Fulvio Melias linear Rhct cosmology for previous discussion see post could be derived without assuming his gravitional radius RhGMRhc I start by assuming a cosmological constant Lambda    L where L is the proper size of the smallest interval of space that can be described by FRW cosmology However if we assume the expanding FRW metric then all spatial intervals expand with the scale factor at This must also include the smallest spatial interval Thus we have L  L at where L is the smallest spatial interval size at the present time t and at Let us assume that the cosmological curvature term Lambda dominates the first Friedmann equation so that we just have begineqnarray leftfracdot aaright  fracLambda c   fracc L   fracc L a endeqnarray This has the linear solution at  fracc tsqrt L                 Melia also defines Rhcdotaa so that we have Rh  c t                           Substituting Equation  back into Equation  we find Rh  sqrt L Thus we have derived Melias Rhct cosmology without assuming his gravitational radius definition of Rh Instead we have an alternative interpretation of Rh it is sqrt times the proper size of the smallest cosmological spatial interval which in turn is given by the speed of light times the present age of the Universe  Does this derivation of Rhct make sense

3128,physics, I have read this question and the answers left me with almost the same question about airboats Assuming that an airboat CoM is below the center of the horizontal thrust provided by the rudder Along with some resistance on the hull from the water this should in my mind create a torque rolling the top of the boat towards the outside of the turn however the opposite appears to happen why I can think of a few of reasons why this might be  My assumption is incorrect that the CoM is below the turning force is that why the drivers are always seated so high The driver compensates by using the torque of the motor or by countersteering There is a force with a significant upward component acting on the outsideside of the hull However I find it difficult to get my mind around how this would instigate the roll in the case of a unicodexb chine ie a simple rectangular hull cross section which many airboats seem to have

3170,physics, It is possible to excite rotations around the axes perpendicular to the bond of a linear molecule However rotation around the axis along the bond of the molecule would require huge energies due to the much smaller moment of inertia which is inversely proportional to the energy This is explained in more detail here In counting degrees of freedom of a linear molecule why is rotation about the axis not counted  Therefore out of three possible rotational degrees of freedom only two are applicable to our linear molecule The third rotation cant be accessed and is frozen out Thus a linear molecule is said to have two rotational degrees of freedom as this third parameter would give us no extra information about the system  Nonlinear molecules have N degrees of freedom in total We know  are translational  are rotational all are allowed for nonlinear molecules so the remaining N are vibrational Linear molecules have  translational and only  rotational and to keep a total of N degrees of freedom they now need N vibrational  Why does the frozen out rotational degree of freedom for linear molecules not count As stated above knowledge of it gives no extra information about the system but at what point does a degree of freedom count as frozen out and need to be compensated for by other vibrational degrees of freedom And is there a deeper physical argument beyond everything needs to add up to N Why N in this case In the general case any molecule can be cooled down so that various degrees of freedom are gradually frozen out Are these degrees of freedom replaced by others and how does the system then know how to vibrate say in a different way Im aware that Im missing something here possibly a fundamental flaw in how I currently understand the concept of degrees of freedom and I greatly appreciate any help

3179,physics, Recently I watched a minutephysics video that suggested that a better name for the beginning of time would be Everywhere stretch because there wasnt a spacetime singularity that formed where the universe began to expand but the expansion happened everywhere  Well if the expansion did happen everywhere that means that space and stuff had already existed So what would happen before that expansion and why cant we see it why dont we receive any signals In the end as you can see he brings up a theory that cannot be excluded which suggests that the beginning of our universe was the end of another because of the Big Crunch the collapse of space on itself If thats true how the does the expansion of the universe decelerates and reverses its direction becoming contraction I mean the gravitational force becomes weaker while the galaxies move away while dark energy continues to push The only think that comes to mind is that sometime in the future the impact of dark energy will become negligible and the gravitational force will overcome it thus making the universe contracting But that would lead to an oscillation of the universepretty stupid ha So every now and then I hear about different interpretations of the Big Bang theory Sometime ago I asked in the forum if the Big Bang really happened thinking that I knew what I was talking aboutbut now I realize I am actually confused So what is really the Big Bang theory to a physicist because I can understand that media distort the picture that we have if we have about it  So sorry for having a lot of questions and expressing them so confusingly my only knowledge on the matter comes from Steven Hawking books and some articles I have numbered the questions so that I avoid causing any more confusion

3235,politics, Yesterday a news story broke about a stenographer on the US Senate floor fainting which prompted a brief recess while she was being medically attended to Hearing this I started to wonder why stenographers are still being employed for this position working from the chamber floor when we live in a day and age where technology could do a better job than having someone listening and handkeying in what they are hearing  Furthermore there are already numerous recording devices in place throughout the chamber floor of the Senate House of Representatives and probably most other state and international governmental chambers Specifically in the case of the US Senate there are more than a few microphones and it also has multiple video feeds recording whats taking place  Modern technology can easily convert spoken audio to text and even though the process isnt perfect it would probably be more accurate if it was automatically converted to text and then reviewed by a stenographer who reviews the recordings of each session against the computergenerated transcription I understand the importance of keeping thorough records and minutes of governmental meetings but in a place like Capital Hill it seems to me that a better more accurate approach to keeping such a records would to implement effective technology Is there a good reason why stenographers are still employed to handgenerate meeting transcripts UPDATE I threw this question out with the very basic assumption that humangenerated transcripts are not necessary when technology is already recording all of this material and autodictation software could certainly transcribe whats being said with moderate accuracy After reading the comments below I further recalled that stenographers actually DO NOT the record words they hear in the typical sense  Instead a stenographer is trained to phonetically type what they hear so that they can type at speeds of over  words per minute I think this makes my question all the more relevant  It is true that speech recognition software is still imperfect but if the system is designed to dissect sounds rather than words the computer could quite possibly do a much better job at transcription that a human  This is because simple sounds even coming at fast speeds would be easier to recognize than entire words

3353,puzzling, I think I made it obvious though I wanted to be poetic a bit philosophical yet simple  To whom do those words belong  By the mouths it is spoken       For I am horrid a face shedding awe grins       None deals       With a buzz of a fly to ears       In the end all that matters       Who remains on top of the stairs   And do they not know surprisingly with a serious face       How to blame another vilifyingly       for their gluttony       And do they not foul oer their guilelessness       Willingly       By their crooky inspirations       By a broken mindset       By such pulses macabre of inclinations   Speechless       For how you behave and how you denounce       Blind to see or not so brave   As my dear Gwyllgi rushes panting       Burning the ground with his breath in flames dancing       Dancing but ruining all they jitter on       When the time arrives sooner than theyd think       That there is nothing left on       Would they realise the fact       Theyve burnt their existence on their own   Oh you younglings takes a breath know not       What means calling my name       Yet do they not know the concords       Made in the past oer the value most precious       That mankind holds   Such ignorance shakes his head       Such arrogance fed by it   And in the end has it not come to the desolate words of nothing       Nothingness       The deafening silence       Of the darkness       Then appear the cacophonical figures       None listens none cares       Speaking loud unwilling to hear the other       However fancying to be minded screams with joy Welcome to the pandemonium       Look how they are altering into hollow   No meaning given to the life       By the entire existence of YOUR kind points out to you       Orbiting the scraps green and grey       Ye twits have no idea what expects you in grave   Halt Listen Hear the whispering speaks with a smooth touching voice Sweet murmur brazing softly to the ears       Like the stars sparkling sharp but delicately carresing       Ought to follow or not to follow       Dont you even think       Not even a single word       You do as it tells just like this   yells in anger in a sudden Yet I HOLD the guilt of all those fools       Pursuing blindly indiscreetly without a second thought       May the shame it holds be revealed       May the faults theyve done be unsealed       For I have been the capra to blame       Even for the sins       Never admitted       Ever imagined       Neither depicted   Would the fame still hold my name       Would I be still hearing the flames       As the thunders hurl       As the floats sweep       As it all collapses at the end   Argh       May my anger never fade calmly Withal I feel no fury but pity       May my will upon humankind never dissolve       Though my taste holds no haste   But one more thing       For Ive come to this world       For I hold the crown here       We shall all see each other       in the place I hold dear grins and disappears in smoke   UPDATE Hint    In many cases he is drawn as he has some spikes on his body

The path may overlap itself but not o trees The more shots the better?

3385,rpg, During a recent game our party came under attack by a Big Bad  The DM introduced it in a suitably epic way the area we were camping on sank  feet per round into a massive pit until there was room for the Gargantuan creature to stalk over and begin pounding us into the dirt  After one round of attacks flat out killed the partys pet NPC paladin and dropped the other frontline fighters to halfstrength it became clear that this was a fight we were intended to run from We did not  In fact we won though Im not sure we should have Our defense relied heavily on a casting of Leomunds Tiny Hut which had already been in place for two hours when the fight began  Per the spell  A footradius immobile dome of force springs into   existence around and above you and remains stationary   for the duration The spell ends if you leave its area Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell   can move through it freely All other creatures and   objects are barred from passing through it  Now we interpreted that to mean that we could fire missile weapons through the hut with impunity and that we could even make melee attacks through the hut as it lists no thickness for the dome and our characters and their weapons could move through it freely  This strikes me as a bit OP for a thirdlevel spell but the casting time implies that it isnt normally intended to be used in combat anyway  I invite comments on the legality of that tactic but my real question is this Should Leomunds Tiny Hut have failed immediately I am aware that previous questions have addressed whether Leomunds Tiny Hut works on a moving surface but this question differs in that the surface in question was normally stationary  This wasnt a ship or an iceberg moving this was the ground beneath us suddenly sinking  Should we have treated the ground as though the hut was cast on a moving area or would it have been more accurate to treat what happened as slowly falling out from under the hut  If the latter is the case and the hut is a dome I believe the spell would have ended the moment the last of the caster passed under the bottom edge of the dome  Does this sound correct

3388,rpg, I am trying to get a precise set of measurements for coneshaped areas of effect so that I can craft a physical template to use as an overlay when playing with miniatures I want to get it right the first time The problem is that the rules for the shape of a cone AoE arent very precise and when you start looking at them closely there are a bunch of inconsistencies These are “good enough” when playing without a grid or when only needing a gridshaped approximation of the area of effect but they are causing me difficulties with crafting an accurate physical template There are three incompatible interpretations of the maximum length of a cone PHB p  emphasis mine  A cones area of effect specifies its maximum length  … which each lead to slightly different template constructions using a  length as the working example  You can use the maximum length as the centreline of an isosceles triangle This would give a template that has a centreline  long but edges beyond the “maximum” length that are  long The end of the area of effect would be a flat plane This shape would encourage players to aim offcentre to use the “bonus” length offered by the edges You can use the maximum length as the edges of an isosceles triangle This would give a template with no portion farther than the maximum away but with a centreline length that is only  The end of the area of effect would be a flat plane This shape would motivate players to do offcentre aiming in order to get full use of the maximumlength edges of the template  You can use the maximum length as a radius of a conical section of a sphere a spherical cone This would result in a template with a rounded end with all points on that arc exactly the maximum length away from the point of origin  Which of these interpretations of the definition of a cones area of effect is the correct one to base my template design and construction on

3426,rpg, Background My players accepted a quest to basically be drug mules delivering illicit goods to a faraway town  When they got alone with the NPC giving the assignment they decided to kill him and take the shipment if illicit goods for themselves  The NPC they killed was part of a large tribe of ruthless orcs and they knew this when they decided to kill him  They had encountered the tribe before and were on speaking terms with them   They buried the body but what they dont know is that the orc had told his friends that he was making a deal and that if anything happened to him the PCs would be to blame   The problem I want the players to realize that killing random people without precedent has repercussions  If they see the group of orcs again the orcs will want their blood   What I want to avoid getting out of this with no consequences I dont think that any persuasion roll or deception roll would be good enough to dissuade a large group of orcs from wanting to tear them limb from limb  But I also dont want the players to feel like theyre being railroaded   Im not trying to avoid a battle with the orcs  Id rather that had to battle with the orcs than be able to lie about having killed one of their tribesmen unprovoked   What I need help with I am unsure of how to deal with the orcs not being open to reason with the players without it feeling cheap in that they cant use deception or persuasion ability checks against the orcs to avoid the angry orcs who want their vengeance  What a good answer will help me do It seems fair to have the orcs be too angry to reason with next time they see them   How do I use the game to reflect that   How can I prevent the party from being able to bluff or persuade the orcs without the loss of player agency

3454,rpg, After first reading through the FC rulebook I came to the conclusion that natural s and natural s werent treated specially as they are in eg DD  Nowhere in the standard attack or skill check sections do they mention them In the places where they mention errors and threats it specifically calls out that for it to be an error or threat the roll must have succeeded So Ive been playing that way for a while but then someone pointed out the following sentence on page  of the rulebook  Statistically  of all rolls fail with a natural  which makes   sense in isolated situations — especially dire desperate ones  I fired up the PDF version and found all occurrences of the word natural and found that to be the only place in the rulebook speaking to treating natural s or s specially

3464,rpg, If an elf uses their trance regularly takes short rests periodically and is willing to forego the benefits of long rests hit points and dice restored spell slots and abilities restored etc is there anything that would require them to take a long rest regularly My understanding is that sleep and long rests are distinct and that either can occur without the other Further there my be repercussions for a character who decides to forego sleep eg exhaustion or CON checks to see if they can stay awake But so far I dont see any explicit penalties for avoiding a long rest in RAW The reason I specify an elf is because some DMs on fora have argued that there is no long rest button eg that once all other conditions have been met a long rest automatically occurs I am considering a cheesy build based on taking no long rests By limiting my character to an elf I can still trance to avoid exhaustion but also avoid  consecutive hours that could be considered a long rest 
3465,rpg, Does the following very cheesy character concept violate any RAW Please cite rules or official rulings in your answer Apart from RAW I expect my DM to disallow or limit the concept in the interest of balance That is not part of my question Elf Multiclass Sorcerer   Warlock   Bard   Never takes a long rest Ever See question Must e elves take a long rest Specifically whether adventuring or not she makes sure that every  hour block includes more than  hours of combat or strenuous activity to ensure that no interpretation of long rest rules would allow a long rest to be automatically triggered Converts warlock spell slots into sorcery points See JeremyECrawfords tweet Converts sorcery points into sorcery spell slots or into spellcasting spell slots once also multiclassing Bard via Flexible Casting Spell slots created from sorcery points disappear upon long rest as per Flexible Casting and a tweet from JeremyECrawford therefore these created spell slots will not disappear until used eg for a character taking no long rests Spell slots created from sorcery points are in addition to and not restoration of the sorcerers spell slots which refresh on a long rest This is not  clear from RAW or clarifications But a Flexible Casting uses the phrase additional Spell Slots b the rule stating that created spell slots disappear on long rests is superfluous if created spell slots can only replace expended spell slots  to have meaning it must be possible to create spell slots which are not replacements c flexible casting does not use the word recover which is the word used for wizards Arcane Recovery Restores warlock spell slots on a short rest and repeats the cycle above converting warlock spell slots to sorcery points to sorcerer or spellcasting spell slots During periods of downtime takes as many short rests per day as permissible to build up a stockpile of created sorcerer spell slots Stockpiling requires using bonus actions out of combat discussed elsewhere Stockpiling requires having short rests on downtime days discussed in a comment below While adventuring during combat uses created spell slots to cast spells andor uses flexible casting to convert those spell slots back into sorcery points While adventuring after combat will use created spell slots with Bard spells to restore hits points since restoring hit points via long rest is unavailable and via hit dice is mostly unavailable  Im pretty sure this is not RAI but does it violate RAW in some way 
3466,rpg, So it was my first time DMing for experienced players and were playing through The Sunless Citadel Most of what happened happened accordingly to the book expect dialogue which I was expecting What I wasnt expecting was the players lighting the entirety of the Twilight Grove on fire Not knowing how the handle the situation I was tempted to not let their inner pyro flourish but decided against it and let them light the place ablaze Was there anyway I could have handled that better as a DM

3468,rpg, I am wondering if i can apply Martial Arts Modified Weapon Damage   You can roll a d in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon This die changes as you gain monk levels as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table  to the Bonus action of Polearm master if i am using a quarterstaff instead of dealing d  When you take the Attack action and attack with only a glaive halberd or quarterstaff you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon The weapons damage die for this attack is a d and the attack deals bludgeoning damage

Having been one of the first words I learned in Russian Ive never bothered to look it up but when I looked it up in Wiktionary today I noticed that Wiktionary which is usually pretty thorough did not provide any perfective counterpart for this verb  Does this mean it doesnt have one  And if so are there many verbs in Russian that dont have an aspectual pairing  In other words do many verbs in Russian have just an imperfective aspect or perfective aspect but not both  Is there a list somewhere

And this time I found the word in the declension chart  So now I know that ????? is one of those past participles that can be used as an adjective but still one question remains What is the difference between ??????? and ??????? 
3517,russian, For me the pronunciation of some words that end with ? sound like they end with ? like ?????? or ??????? but others dont like ????? What is the reason for this Do we say always ? when it ? is unstressed and at the end of the word Would we otherwise say ?

3559,russian, Today Ive heard on the radio that news presenter pronounced ????????? depicted like ?????????? upd  here is a link checkout  This sounds to me definitely wrong For me pronouncing this word wit stress on the last syllable which is defacto standard is the only form accepted My first thought was that this is yet another example of long lasting phenomena in Russian language words which are constantly spelled without ? finally lose phonemes indicated by this letter One wellknown example is ????? who was actually ????? Or ?????? which is pronounced by many as ??????? or even by few though ???????  Then Ive realized that the main reason that ?????????? hurts my feeling is actually that it sound like another russian word with same root ???????????? disfigured Contrary to ????????? the only linguistic norm I can recall is to pronounce ??????????? with penultimate stressing So my question is Where should I put stress in both of this words and if rules are different for them which of form had actually been original one ie can we talk about the loss of ? here or vice versa or may be both form coexisted from the very beginning To put it simple treat this as a subquestion Does ??????????? form ever existed and if it havent what are rules regulating such stressing Why for example we say ??????? ????????? ????????? but ???????????

3645,salesforce, Prior to winter  we were able to customize the display of the pageHeader image by referencing the class noassignedimage in our markup  We used this to create a custom theme and provide our customers with the ability to control things from a single location Today I deployed into a new sandbox  What I now see is that there is no header image in our custom theme  If I switch the theme back to Napili the header shows up Investigating it a bit more what I am seeing is that the markup for the header in Winter  Napili has changed significantly and the CSS we used to rely on doesnt appear relevant anymore   It looks like now the background image is driven through siteforceServiceBody cHeaderPanel   That cHeaderPanel makes me think they moved some of this stuff into a lightning component that gets the background image somehow   I also noticed the  CSS is originating from stylestyle tags instead of from appcss now  Im not sure if that is new or reflective of some architectural change in direction but I dont see it in the previous template Can anyone point me in a good direction for troubleshooting this  My hope was that perhaps the pageHeader existed as a token now but I dont see any evidence supporting that   Id really like to be able to continue to leverage the existing image upload functionality that the branding editor provides but we need to be able to have control over the header

3649,scifi, I am looking for the name of a series of book In the world described in those books magic exists and it is also told that the th child of a family will be extremely proficient with it In the first book we are following the story of a family whose father is one of those th sons but is nothing extraordinary when it comes to magic At the start of said book we learn that his wife gave birth to a child which is their th th son of a th son But sadly it seems like the child died shortly after  We also learn of another family which is celebrating the birth of their newborn daughter but during the celebration an assassination takes place and only the newborn daughter survives What was particular with this assassination is the fact that the killer used bullets with a name inscribed on them Those bullets are known to always find their way to the person their destined to After surviving this the daughter was adopted by the first family  A few traits of this world which can help identify the book   While magic exists it doesnt seems that everyone can be a mage and only a few select ones can excel in it The most powerful mage in the country is given a position of authority and usually takes an apprentice amongst the most promising mages and usually that apprentice will take that position after their master  A few key events in the first book that can help   After the assassination of the second family which was something akin to royalty a new government takes place This government created a militia which enrolled many young children to indoctrinate them  At the end of the first book we learn that one of those young children was in fact the seventh child of the first family which they thought died at birth  After a while the new government learns about the whereabouts of the daughter of the second family and sends assassins against her So the first family who adopted the daughter decides to take refuge with their aunt who is somewhat of a hermit and is living in a remote location   If anyone is able to identify the book from this mess of a question that would be really helpful 
3650,scifi, Did the Klingons show any honor at all in the first episodes of Star Trek Discovery In episodes  and  they spent a lot of time making a big deal about honor and all that and then   rammed the ship while cloaked  From what I know as a longtime Trekkie they are not acting at all like Kahless the Unforgettable acted in regards to honor Am I missing something about how Klingons view honor 
3651,scifi, In episode  of season  there is a chilling scene with Tywin Cersei and    soon to be King Tommen  Tywin gives a history lesson and talks about the three rulers that lacked wisdom They were Baelor who was holy the last was Robert who was strong but the second one he mentions I am unfamiliar with His name was either Orys or Horace and Tywin talked about him being just but it didnt stop him from being murdered in his sleep by his brother I do not remember anything like this from the books so I am wondering which king Tywin is speaking about Perhaps Orys Baratheon who was Aegons bastard brother but I dont remember anything about him being murdered 
3652,scifi, I recognize that there are a few discussions on here already about how humans can properly survive a multiyear winter on Planetos but Ive not yet seen one about the animals Note that my question is totally notwithstanding the possible conversion of animals into wightimals   Specifically thinking of the fact that even animals in our world end up often hibernating for a few months during the worst of the winter and all the animals able to be active in the winter are specially adapted for doing so Im wondering how it is that common animals such as deer and birds which are not adapted for polar conditions can find enough food and warmth to get through multiple years of winter especially the ones that last a decade or more   Carnivores would probably have it good for a while but I dont see herbivores lasting long without ample plant life and carnivores wont last long without herbivores   Ive read the whole series several times and am aware of no real discussion of how wild animals manage Perhaps something in a world book or interview Id prefer a book answer but if this was mentioned in the TV show then I suppose that would be interesting as well   
3653,scifi, In A Storm of Swords Arya is running with Gendry through a forest and is telling the direction via the moss  But theres no sun How do you know From the moss See how it grows mostly on one side of the trees Thats south  A Storm of Swords Arya I  And later  On the morning of the third day Arya notice that the moss was growing mostly on the wrong side of the trees Were going the wrong way she said to Gendry as they rode past an especially mossy elm Were going south See how the moss is growing on the trunk  A Storm of Swords Arya III  I know that in reality moss doesnt only grow on one side of the trees but in the northern hemisphere it tends to grow more heavily on the north side of the trees as the sun is angled slightly southward due to the axial tilt of the Earth causing more shade to be on the north side of the tree I am unfamiliar with how it grows in the southern hemisphere as I have never visited As posted in the comments here is a link to a question about moss and which side of the tree it grows on where Since the further north you go in Westeros the colder it gets and the south is a desert type region that is also warm I would postulate that they are also in the northern hemisphere of their planet As such would the moss not then grow on the north side of their trees as well not towards the south as Arya is suggesting 
3654,scifi, In the episode Defiant of Deep Space Nine Tom Riker Will Rikers transporter accidentcreatedtwin from Next Generation comes to DS disguised as Will  When he still in disguise bumps into Miles OBrien the chief greets him warmly but Riker says I have nothing to say to you OBrien You know why   I have always wondered what this was about  Obviously if youre impersonating someone whom you dont know very well Will Riker having had  or so more years of life than Tom you dont want to interact with people well known to the person youre impersonating because they may catch you out in an inconsistency so was this simply a way for Tom to get rid of OBrien to avoid an awkward situation  If so then it was foolish on Toms part because if there was no dispute the chief might start to wonder why Riker was snubbing him  So can we assume that Will Riker and the chief had had some falling out and Tom had found out through intelligence gathering somehow If this is so is it ever explained what this falling out was all about  I know Riker and Worf had some disagreements over Deanna Troi either in the real universe or some quantum alternative But I dont remember any problem between the chief and Riker from the TNG series or the movies  Does anyone know 
3655,scifi, One of the first series Ive ever read was about a young boy who was learning to become a mage In this world it was possible to summon demons of different categories ranging from small and not very powerful Fairylike creatures to Gargoylelike midpowerful creatures up to giant monsters devouring everything in sight  What made this series special was the way it was written Whenever the demon who was summoned by the young boy was narrating the story he used cynical annotations about the current situation It was very funny and the incharacter reason for providing the annotations was that the puny human readers wouldnt be able to understand the grand way in which he was thinking about everything at the same time Therefore he provided the reader with annotations to make it easier to follow his line of thinking  I absolutely loved the humor The story itself was about having to steal certain items from more powerful wizards and trying to escape the problems that arose from these acts I think With each book a few years passed and in the last one he was working in some sort of agency not really a young boy anymore  There were three books in the series and one prologue book that Ive read I remember that one of the catchphrases or signature spells or things like that which the demon used regularly was introduced in the prologue book A funny think because of how he always tried to emphasize how much of a genious and how original in his thinking he was  Ive read the books in German The title contained the name of the demon something like name here and the item to be stolen Other random things I remember  the demon was always trying not to get into any trouble he loved to send weaker demons into the fight and wait for everything to settle down the wizards had to be extremely careful when telling the demons what to do  they were not allowed any special intonations breathing  when commanding the demons so as not to give them a chance to misinterpret the intent there was a dozen of categories for the demons each one with a different name  Can you help me remember which series this is   Insert funny text here as an example  Magical creatures are just better at everything

3663,scifi, In TNG First Contact the episode not the film Picard claims  there is no starship mission more dangerous than that of first contact We never know what we will face when we open the door on a new world how we will be greeted what exactly the dangers will be Centuries ago a disastrous contact with the Klingon Empire led to decades of war It was decided then we would do surveillance before making contact It was a controversial decision I believe it prevented more problems than it created   In the first episode of Enterprise Broken Bow we witness first contact between humans and the Klingons — but it doesnt seem that disastrous  A Klingon scout ship pursued by the Suliban had crashed on Earth  The pilot was shot by a human farmer but he was restored to health and great effort was expended by Archer to return him to QonoS thereby allowing the pilot to complete his mission which was to return information about the Suliban to the Klingon High Command In Broken Bow it is also made clear that the Vulcans were already aware of the Klingons and had diplomatic ties with QonoS  These relations while terse did not seem overtly hostile So what exactly was Picard referring to  Why and how did first contact with the Klingons lead to war

3670,scifi, Plot SummaryDetails The basic premise of this one as best that I can remember it is that a farmer who has recently dug a new well has discovered some sort of strange beings living underground near his well  I dont remember the details of how but they communicate through notes loweredraised in the wells bucket  At one point the farmer and his wife send down a roast turkey dinner which the beings below enjoy For reasons I cannot remember the farmer either becomes angry with or exceptionally curious about the beings below  He descends the well one evening possibly armed with a shotgun possibly not The chilling twist to the story comes the next day went the wife retrieves the bucket from the well   The beings write that they really enjoyed the live turkey she sent them and would like more  The live turkey of course was the farmer who was eaten by the creatures below Other Details I remember not only reading this one as a kid but also seeing a tv show adaptation of it  I thought it was the old Rod Serling show Night Gallery but I have not been able to find that particular story yet  I also seem to remember hearing the story told at summer camp a few times which makes me wonder if the story has its roots in some old storylegend Timeframe of Publication Id guess no later than the s probably a lot earlier

3682,scifi, In Injustice Gods Among Us and other elseworlds stories the main theme is usually Superman for whatever reason decides to stop playing nice and enforces peace Being the Man of Steel he typically has no trouble doing this Batman and sometimes a small handful of other heroes take the role of the freedom fighters opposing Supermans dictatorial regime I find this interesting because Batman is typically the person with the skillset that one would associate with a police state  He has files on literally every person on earth he keeps black mail he has worldwide surveillance he can hack into and disable just about any persons electronics  Not to mention he has butt loads of disposable income That being said in a story where the Justice League starts to enforce peace has batman ever been the dictator to another leaguers freedom fighter 
3683,scifi, In About A Girl we learn that   Every  years or so a Moclan female is born     Yet not only do we later learn that    Bortus mate Klyden was born female    Their daughter was born female    Their most famous author under a pseudonym Heveena was a female  Clearly this seems indicate the original claim as wrong although there are a number of possible resolutions    The original claim was mistaken propaganda or a coverup    The childs gender was somehow influenced by Klydens but how does Moclan reproduction work anyway    Moclans are very longlived and the  years is accurate        What is the correct resolution of this apparent dissonance 
3684,scifi, Six or seven years ago I saw this show with a kid with brown hair that would use crystals to make creatures appear They would have to go to a different world to do it  One of the main monsters was a rhinoceros that could shoot vines and another like a big blue hairy dog 
3685,scifi, Although it is not common in Westeros for women to receive training to wield a weapon we have seen exceptions in the cases of Arya Stark Yara Greyjoy Brienne of Tarth and Meera Reed Having said that I do not expect women like Cersei Margaery or Sansa to have this inclination I cant recall Daenerys Targaryen engaging herself with weapons in any of the  episodes of Game of Thrones   Is there any evidence direct or suggestive that Daenerys inclines to learn to wield a weapon in any of the  ASOIAF books Dragon riding and control doesnt count Information after ASOS can be put in spoiler tags

3687,scifi, There already exists a question about whether muggles can use a magic wand to cast magic However my question is about other kinds of enchanted items like the Weasleys flying car Harrys mantle of invisibility Flying brooms Sirius Blacks Flying motorcycle Knight Bus etc where I didnt notice any mention of someone casting a spell in order to operate them Is the nature of the enchantments such that operating them involves purely mechanical skill that even muggles are capable of or is there some kind of hidden channelling of the operators magic abilities happening behind the scenes

3690,scifi, In what order and when were Voldemorts Horcruxes made I found a list with destruction dates But not creation date 
3691,scifi, I recognize that there are a few discussions on here already about how humans can properly survive a multiyear winter on Planetos but Ive not yet seen one about the animals Note that my question is totally notwithstanding the possible conversion of animals into wightimals   Specifically thinking of the fact that even animals in our world end up often hibernating for a few months during the worst of the winter and all the animals able to be active in the winter are specially adapted for doing so Im wondering how it is that common animals such as deer and birds which are not adapted for polar conditions can find enough food and warmth to get through multiple years of winter especially the ones that last a decade or more   Carnivores would probably have it good for a while but I dont see herbivores lasting long without ample plant life and carnivores wont last long without herbivores   Ive read the whole series several times and am aware of no real discussion of how wild animals manage Perhaps something in a world book or interview Id prefer a book answer but if this was mentioned in the TV show then I suppose that would be interesting as well

3693,scifi, Did the Klingons show any honor at all in the first episodes of Star Trek Discovery In episodes  and  they spent a lot of time making a big deal about honor and all that and then   rammed the ship while cloaked  From what I know as a longtime Trekkie they are not acting at all like Kahless the Unforgettable acted in regards to honor Am I missing something about how Klingons view honor 
3694,scifi, In Legends it was said that when an ARC fighter had its shields on it could fly x times faster in an atmosphere hitting hypersonic speed Has any canon sourcebook said that as well 
3695,scifi, So Ive read some similar topics and none of them match perfectly The book I read has a scientist communicating with trees possibly on a foreign planet and studying them The trees respond to music played on the flute if I remember correctly The local natives at one point in the story dont believe that the junior scientist is really showing them a message from the senior scientist because its on a laptop and while they had learned to read they dont understand enough to know that she didnt just type the message herself and that its really from the senior scientist Thats about all I can remember  
3696,scifi, Kara DanversSupergirl lives in National City which appears to be at least a moderately large city though smaller than Metropolis  We know from various episodes that  it is relatively near a mountainous area with a drydesert climate where the DEO does training exercises Supergirl can fly far quickly but her sister Alex works at the DEO base and lives somewhere in National City    it has a large enough waterway to allow oil tankers into port    it is onnear a river or a bay with a large bridge    Where is National City located 
3697,scifi, In A Storm of Swords Arya is running with Gendry through a forest and is telling the direction via the moss  But theres no sun How do you know From the moss See how it grows mostly on one side of the trees Thats south  A Storm of Swords Arya I  And later  On the morning of the third day Arya notice that the moss was growing mostly on the wrong side of the trees Were going the wrong way she said to Gendry as they rode past an especially mossy elm Were going south See how the moss is growing on the trunk  A Storm of Swords Arya III  I know that in reality moss doesnt only grow on one side of the trees but in the northern hemisphere it tends to grow more heavily on the north side of the trees as the sun is angled slightly southward due to the axial tilt of the Earth causing more shade to be on the north side of the tree I am unfamiliar with how it grows in the southern hemisphere as I have never visited As posted in the comments here is a link to a question about moss and which side of the tree it grows on where Since the further north you go in Westeros the colder it gets and the south is a desert type region that is also warm I would postulate that they are also in the northern hemisphere of their planet As such would the moss not then grow on the north side of their trees as well not towards the south as Arya is suggesting 
3698,scifi, An important part of the journey of Daenerys is the remnants of the khalasar of Khal Drogo She leads them through the Red Wastes to Qarth boards the frightened Dothraki onto ships and sails for Astapor Following this however the mentions of the Dothraki become few and far between both in the novels and the TV show We know the fates of Irri and Doreah but what of Jhiqui I saw some Dothraki briefly in the TV show guarding the tent of Daenerys when meeting the Second Sons in  or  So my question is who and how many of Daenerys old khalasar are left Are they integrated into her court Do they serve with the Unsullied 
3699,scifi, There are three problems with the setting of Game of Thrones   Because if the continent of Westeros in the show and books are probably set on either a parallel Earth or a very Earthlike alien world  But the problem is that we find out that there are roughly forty years of winter for every ten years of summer it could be more or less so this planet is obviously not Earth because it must have a very different orbit to our world It obviously takes fifty Earth years to orbit their sun and the planet is only positioned for summer for a short period of that time  But we see in the opening credits that Westeros is inside the shell of a planet and at the centre is their large mechanical artificial sun I dont think the opening credits of the show show us what is literally happening I think its an artists representation so its good to bear this point in mind but safe to ignore it   So any ideas  EDIT  I believe I have confused some people with this question first of all the story tells us something along the lines of The summers last years and the winters last lifetimes Im not sure what the exact wording is but whether the tilt of the planet or the distance from the sun or the atmosphere is responsible is irrelevant I think we can agree that its not Earth or at least not our version of Earth  What I was hoping for was a little specific info on what this planet is for example Lord of the Rings happens in a lost age in Europe back when Elves Hobbits and Dwarves shared the world with man so we know Middle Earth is Earth Also we know Masters of the Universe happens on Eternia Transformers happens on Earth and Cybertron so what planet does Game of Thrones happen on

3708,scifi, In the film The Goblet of Fire a witness accuses Barty Crouch Jr of a crime to a court The witness was trying to avoid being sent back to Azkaban so he could have merely been making it up Why didnt the accused at least try to act innocent in the movie Why does he try to deny it in the book but not in the movie

3711,scifi, Ive got this story in my mind for years maybe some details are wrong but Im sure about the general storyline also this could be from a French novel so Im not aware is this made it outside France   Our hero just moved to a small cityvillage with his mother Im sure a cat maybe a sibling  The young boy finds magic circles a summoning demon thing in the cave of their new house His neighbour iswas a witch and teaches him about magic with a wand I think Later the cat kills a rat in the cave on the summoning circle and the blood wakes up a demon The story took place nowadays I read it around  but the book could be a little bit older  This is all Im sure about this story again this could be from a French novel so Im not sure itll recall something to someone Thanks in advance

3713,scifi, In Star Trek Discovery during the seasons opening episode they are stranded on the planet and have no way to communicate to the ship due to storms So the captain walks in a pattern to make the Starfleet insignia in the sand visible from space This seems impossible since even the Great Wall of China is not actually visible from space without aid and they didnt even know to be looking for any visual sign as far as we know  Outside of using sensors unless they are searching for the symbol they would never even know to look for  How are they found 
3714,scifi, Do magical children have a higher risk of dying in accidents fights etc than Muggle children Young magical children are able to do magic unconsciously In book one Harry finds himself on a roof This sounds quite accidentprone or are young wizard children under constant supervision by their parents Second magical children like to play Quidditch sometimes without supervision by a third person in book two the Weasley brothers play in a meadow behind their home Wizards have spells and potions to fix broken bones but how would that help a dead person with a broken neck Third in Hogwarts children are regularly working with powerful spells and poisons For example in book one Harry and his friends knock out a troll by accidentally levitating and dropping his club on his head Couldnt something similar happen between the students Finally Hogwarts seems to be quite an abusive environment where the house system and the teachers encourage competition and hatred between the students Pubescent teenagers with the capability of casting spells What could go wrong Are there any remarks or explanations in the books or by the author 
3715,scifi, When Daenerys is scouting for an army the Unsullied are initially made out to be an extremely strong and fearless force However they get their butts kicked each time by the Harpies  particularly in the scene in the alleyway How is that  Are we made to think the Harpies are better fighters than the Unsullied  
3716,scifi, Phrasing this question vaguely to avoid spoilers Those who have read the book should find it pretty clear In The Last Colony there is a subplot involving a intelligent native species on the planet of Roanoke After an attempt to in a sense contact this species the matter is dropped and they are never mentioned again Considering the nature and habits of this species and the fact that they are a new intelligent life form sharing this planet the lack of further interaction seems hard to explain What happened to resolve this situation and why was it not at least mentioned in passing 
3717,scifi, In the pilot episode of Star Trek Discovery they used Star Warsstyle holograms for communication with Starfleet I dont recall seeing that in the series set before or after but perhaps Im wrong I know that holograms have been widely used in TNG and even more in Voyager but I just dont remember them being used for communications like this 
3718,scifi, I know that the appearance of Klingons was different between Enterprise and TOS due to the mutagenic virus Having said that I dont understand how the look of the Klingons on last nights pilot fits in chronologically or otherwise Why did they have no hair Why did their skin and ridges look different Isnt this set just before TOS chronologically If so shouldnt they have been affected by the virus like the ones in TOS

3724,scifi, Star Trek Discovery Main character slams into a Klingon on the outside of the Klingon Space RelicShrine and somehow made him stab himself with his own batleth this seems like a accidental kill more then an outright kill So wouldnt this technically be an accident Also didnt the Klingon Clearly Attack her first

3726,scifi, It seems to me that Benjen may be a White Walker  His squad was ambushed Some of his squad were turned into wights Wights are only created by White Walkers At the end of season  we can see that the White Walker not only shares his same chin strap goatee but also his hair and hairline I know this is all circumstantial but do you all think this could be a possibility

3729,scifi, In Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone Draco Malfoy boasts about escaping from helicopters  He Malfoy complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone Chapter   Yet it seems that the wizarding community especially a family like the Malfoys  is quite ignorant of muggle technology for example see how blind are wizard to muggle technology Furthermore it would seem that they dont live anywhere near Muggles the chances of running into a helicopter are slim  My questions are Is it likely that Malfoy is telling the truth about the helicopters And if so how does he know about muggle helicopters 
3730,scifi, In her third year at Hogwarts Hermione is given a timeturner so she can take more classes Several of her classes are concurrent to each other so she attends one class for  hours goes back in time and attends a different class during the same time frame But from an aging point of view she should age  hours in relation to the  hours everyone else ages How much older should Hermione be relative to everyone else after using the timeturner for an entire school year

3734,scifi, After reading a few other questions where people were talking about how dangerous knowledge of Muggle weaponry would be on the world of wizardry It made me think how could they not know about it In the films Arthur Weasley asks Harry what the function of a rubber duck is  something trivially easy to find out but he makes it sound like some big mystery We know the Ministry  a kind of pseudobranch of British government  has a Muggle research division and that Hogwarts has a Muggle studies class How incompetent are these people I understand that technology vulnerable to EM has been reasoned to not work near magic in other questions here but even free newspapers available all around London would give a wealth of knowledge they seem to lack I have also read in passing peoples theories of wizards distancing Muggleborns from their roots But Id think any Muggleborn given initiation starting at  years of age could explain at least a rubber duck EDIT To clarify A lot of people are telling me they dont care Though as an extension of my question I would ask why Are we to assume theyre just isolationist Xenophobic Racist towards Muggles

3748,security, An interesting feature of HTML is the input pattern  attribute which allows the browser to validate the input fields value against a regular expression provided by the developer Subsequently this binds to the fields ValidityState which can then be queried for UX feedback to prevent invalid submission and so on The server implements the same precondition validation as well as XSRF Given this is this clientside validation pattern mature and adequate or is it for some reason still desirable to intercept the entire form and subject it to traditional perfield validation before submitting it

3753,security, I recently had a discussion with a Docker expert about the security of Docker vs virtual machines When I told that Ive read from different sources that its easier for code running within a Docker container to escape from it than for a code running in a virtual machine the expert explained that Im completely wrong and that Docker machines are actually more secure in terms of preventing the malicious code from affecting other machines compared to virtual machines or bare metal Although he tried to explain what makes Docker containers more secure his explanation was too technical for me From what I understand “OSlevel virtualization reuses the kernelspace between virtual machines” as explained in a different answer on this site In other words code from a Docker container could exploit a kernel vulnerability which wouldnt be possible to do from a virtual machine Therefore what could make it inherently more secure to use Docker compared to VMs or bare metal isolation in a context where code running in a containermachine would intentionally try to escape and infectdamage other containersmachines Lets assume Docker is configured properly which prevents three of the four categories of attacks described here

3765,security, Please help me with a theoretical Bitcoin equivalent called FooCoins that are encrypted inside small phone electronics that are difficult to modify and hack using a closed source OS  BitCoins use the fastest processors to mine coins and verify accounts and hash keys FooCoins arent mined via processing they can only be bought by trading physical items and standard currencies and they have a non centralized stack verification based on puzzle solving An encrypted code is sent to all the other phones in G and they all compete to solve a problem using that code and another challenge starts Q Can computation expense still be used to verify accounts The FooPhones all have the same processing power and they randomly can win the verification task  Q Can FooCoin OS on mobiles be hacked by fast PCs that use false IDs

3770,security, Today I tried a program called Dumpper and the program showed me default WPS of all of my neighbor access points without bruteforcing them see screenshot below  I had to cover BSSID and ESSID of the routers so my question is thi How this program exactly works

3772,security, Based on the Technical White Paper httpgoarmiscomhubfsBlueBorneTechnicalWhitePaperpdft After reading it I understand it as follows Page  bottom So to exploit Linux kernel RCE vulnerability  CVE there are two actors Attacker and Victim  Attacker sends Configuration Request with EFS element with stype set to LCAPSERVNOTRAFIC  Attacker sends Configuration Response with result field set to LCAPCONFPENDING and possibly repeated parameters for example many MTUs values to trigger stack overflow I am confused since since I thought the Victim should send Configuration Response based on Configuration request from the Attacker but in the paper it is described as above Is this correct Did I misread it Can somebody expaincorrect me on this Thanks Update  When it helps somebody here is a Conf Request Wireshark trace Have these  adapters Client  ADDA Server  FAC Here with the client I set MTU to  lcapclient ADDA mtu ok  lcapserver  accepted connection from FAC   Can somebody explain this I have TCPIP background  What does it mean localhost Why it sends from localhost to Client Conf req than from Client to localhost Redvd Conf Req than Server sends to localhost Recvd Conf Req and than from localhost to Server Sent Conf Response is sent and at the end Client and Server send to localhost Recv Conf Response  Success Update  Found this based on this each device should send a Conf Request and each request should receive a Conf Response  Why it looks so weird than in my Wireshark trace Update  Ok I think I figured it out Attacker  Sends Sent Configure Request DCID x Attacker sends Configuration Request with EFS element with stype set to LCAPSERVNOTRAFIC Receives at the same time conf request from other party Rcvd Configure Request DCID x Sends Attacker sends Configuration Response with result field set to LCAPCONFPENDING and possibly repeated parameters for example many MTUs values to trigger stack overflow Update  Going to next step  crafting the frames here is my next questions if anybody is interested on SO httpsstackoverflowcomquestionsbluetoothreplydataframeusingltest

3774,security, I usually do technical part of security so do not familiar with security policy area Risk assessment measurement and evaluation is always taken in an organization such as identify vulnerability threat impact of threat risk treatment options and so on I want to see know how this risk assessment methodsproceduresresults will impact the organizations information security policies Or I can ask in this way How risk assessment can improve the information security policy What is the implications of risk assessment for IS security policy I prefer some formal explainsdescriptions instead of oral summary

3780,security, Like any field you must model someone to be successful I am interested in computers and particularly security i love hacking and finding flaws vulnerabilities in computers systems Also this is a kind of field you gotta have the environment to keep going or some kind of motivation I m curious to know how do people consistently keep going and become the giants in cyber security For me i love security but its hard to keep going with other distraction in my life and sometimes i totally forget to work on it and then come back to it again Its my studiesMSc Computer Science keep me reminded about that topic I m currently working on a project for my PG DIPLOMA IN INFORMATION SECURITY

  The weird part is this script has been there since April but now is September so I think this is not the cause then I am using netstat for open port but once again there are nothing suspicious found Really need your help guys Thank you 
3784,security, What are the security risks associated with enabling setDomStorageEnabledtrue method Reference 
3785,security, So I was trying to download an arcade game everything seemed legit and I guess I was too excited to play it I started running it  only after clicking it I decided to run a scan on both Avira and Malwarebytes As it was running Malwarebytes picked up a TrojanDropper the game itself works but I deleted it promptly after quarantining the malicious file Now reading about droppers says they tend to alter your registry keys and create hidden files In fact Avira sent a prompt saying something just tried to edit my registry I have no idea how to look for those to ensure my system is clean How should I go about that Ive done a full system scan on both the software  Ive used a registry scanner and scanned for changes in the registry within  min beforeafter the item was quarantined which came up to about  entries would it be best to put that into a pastebin to see if anything could have been malicious Thanks 
3786,security, so our Head of IT called me and told me someone sent him our server etcpasswd content and said this man has done sql injection on our server So I checked each user history logs and found nothing I am also check authlog but nothing suspicious happened Then I installed clamav scan all the directory using clamscan r i   found these files

3802,security, Many websites require JavaScript However enabling JS means that a website can run a JS snippet to retrieve the users IP address even if they are behind a proxy or VPN So how can I the user feed spoof the VPN IP address which I have in a text file to any JS that might run so that it all looks the same to the web server Edit  Addition  after doing a little research i came across this site httpmybrowserinfocomdetailaspbhcp  that displays a bunch of info that my browser is sending to the web server Browser version local time screen and browser dimension connection speed ect  This combo of info allows a malicious authority say the Chinese govt to fingerprint the user even if they do not have the IP address because the user is behind a VPN and WebRTC has been disabled  How do i disable or clean this information such that the web server cant identify the user  Is this all from WebRCT I suspect some of this info is coming from the UserAgent string which i suppose the user could manually change but what about the rest  Some must be coming from javascript no

3807,security, When I was young and had just started out in my softwaredevelopment career  years ago I wrote a little bit of code on my Amiga that took a password but also recorded within some threshold the speed at which each letter of a password was typed This meant that not only did the user have to type in the right password they also had to time the keypresses  To test it Id have a rhythm in my head and could consistently retype the password every time  However if I just typed it out regularly or slowly it was not accepted I am no security expert my programming lies in lessdifficult areas thankfully but I just suddenly thought about that program I wrote when I was young and whether it was a viable addition to security these days or whether its not even worth thinking about Tap  Taptaptap  TapTap  Tap

3862,skeptics, Wim Hof practices several techniques which he claims lead to voluntarily influencing the immune system resulting in increased resistance to toxins and the cold The techniques are categorised into breathing exercises training of mindset and gradual exposure to the cold A vice documentary on Wim can be found here a summary of the video follows  Wim Hof first caught the attention of scientists when he proved he was able to use meditation to stay submerged in ice for  hour and  minutes without his core body temperature changing Since then he’s climbed Mount Everest in his shorts resisted altitude sickness completed a marathon in the Namib Desert with no water and proven under a laboratory setting that he’s able to influence his autonomic nervous system and immune system at will Almost everything Wim has done was previously thought to be impossible  but he’s not a freak of nature To demonstrate that any human can learn his methods Wim offered to teach Matt Shea and DaisyMay Hudson to climb a freezing cold mountain in their shorts without getting cold But when Matt and Daisy signed up for the training they had no idea that the socalled Iceman was planning to lead them on a psychedelic journey across Europe that circled the chasm between science spirituality and mystery  Some scientific journals exploring these claims include  httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC httpswwwnaturecomnewsbehaviouraltrainingreducesinflammation  Quoting from the PNAS article  Healthy volunteers were randomized to either the intervention n   or control group n   Subjects in the intervention group were trained for  d in meditation third eye meditation breathing techniques ia cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath retention and exposure to cold ia immersions in ice cold water The control group was not trained Subsequently all subjects underwent experimental endotoxemia iv administration of  ngkg Escherichia coli endotoxin In the intervention group practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels In the intervention group plasma levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels and were higher Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF? IL and IL were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL levels Finally flulike symptoms were lower in the intervention group  I am not a biologist  medical researcher by training so I was wondering  Q What issues if any are there with the PNAS article Q More generally do these techniques or a subset of these techniques seem viable

3864,skeptics, One of the most frequent claims on selfhelp pop psychology and law of attraction books is that the mindalso they said that is the subconscious mind cant know the difference between a reallife experience and imaginaryfake ones They give the example of when you watch a horror movie your brain triggers fear and anxiety because the mind cant differentiate that the movie is a fake experience from a real one Also another example is that if you visualize a situation in the future that isnt true in the present  for example you imagine yourself winning the lottery and visualize all the things you will be doing with the money you can trick the mind into believing that the visualization is the real life another thing they say is that when you imagine yourself playing guitar your brain is triggering the same neural paths that would be triggered if you were playing guitar in the real life so they make the claim that if you imagine yourself practicing guitar you will improve your skill because the imagination will trigger a neuroplasticity process that improves that skill Are these claims true or false

3889,skeptics, Questions about whether alcohol consumption is good for you or not have been asked here before see Is alcohol beneficial in small amounts and Recommended alcohol drinking quantity are they just making it up  But a recent review of the evidence about alcohol in Pacific Standard which concludes that americans especially are too obsessed about the amount they drink and have poor quality public health advice on the subject makes an additional claim that deserves to be addressed my highlight for the claim  The more alcohol a society consumes the fewer alcoholrelated problems and alcoholrelated deaths including cirrhosis it has since these societies such as those in Southern Europe integrate drinking with social life   The basic argument notes that moderate drinking is good for you according to the mortality statistics It then emphasises that binge drinking is the most harmful pattern of drinking Then it argues that US public health advice tends towards encouraging people not to drink regularly thus instilling a general fear about addiction and an unwarranted general praise of the virtues of abstention Which in practice doesnt work skewing actual behaviours towards the worst drinking patterns a little like the known problem with abstinence only sex education This argument leads on to the claim that I think deserves some skeptical analysis It is derived from the idea that those with more sensible attitudes to booze both drink more and suffer fewer harms More explicitly the question is Do societies who consume more alcohol tend to suffer fewer harms as a result

3921,softwareengineering, The team im in is moving to use couchbase rather than elasticsearch DB  Now this is only an example but my question is more general  In elasticsearch you have the notion of parentchild relationships   When we move to a standard key value store we dont have these My Question Assuming I do want to enforce relationships such as  When parent is deleted all children should be deleted When child is deleted parents which had a pointer to this child should be updated Child is rather large doc so we have a pointer from parent to child  Which design would yo go with Option  Build a general layer on top of the KV store which knows to handle parent child relationships such that your programmers only need to specify relationships and your generic sophisticateddao layer will know to handle these relationships Option  Relationships should not be managed by DAO layer so the above logical layer should manage it  No generic solution each domain entity which has this relationships should write their own code in logical layer to manage this layer Option  Parents hold children in same doc  one doc both parent and children  not going to do that children are too big and there are other types of children as well more reasons I can specify if needed Option  Use specific db features  I want to avoid that so next time we migrate into a different db I wont need to face this problem yet again  A solution that will work for any KV Option  Dont move to KV store  move to a relational database or keep current dbupdated by thimothy comment this is beyond my control we will move to KV so this option is out of question There topmost preference is for speed above any db features Option  Have an async process which manages the relations so if I delete a child in our childparent example then if a client gets the parent then fetches each of child by its id it would see a child does not exist only  min later an async process will see this inconsistency and fix it in our case the client would need to decide if this inconsistency is a real error or a temporal inconsistency  This is a possible solution so named as option  however I fear that each developer would get who knows where errors and would need to decide whether this is an ok state and to ignore or not Option  Event sourcing so that I keep replaying and rerunning at least or compensating in case of a failure where parent is updated and child is not but I think this does not solve the whole thing childparent i would still have multiple commands and events and its not like one transaction right now although I would be happy to use event sourcing im not at this point maybe in future on a total refactor of codebase no immediate remedy this can give me I know that this kind of questions tend not to have a definite answer I would like to know if anyone faced this general question before and wether its best to come up with a general framework a general DAO which knows to manage these relationships or let any developer manage his own relationships Please take into consideration that giving each developer the responsibility to manage his own relations is dubious because the more developers you have the more you want to have some base infrastructures and not reinventing the wheel or being inconsistent in between teams think enterprise  However in my case im not sure I do want to build this whole architecture and layers above a KV my tendency is currently If I have a KV allow the enduserdevelopers manage by own the dependencies however this leaves too much room for each to come up with his own solution which option would you choose UPDATE I think for me the best route to go would be under the assumption of a KV store without relationships  Do not implement generic relationships layer on top of the KV store Light DAO layer Each logicalservice layer which uses the light DAO layer would need to implement the relationships in its business logic  As an appendix to that if a programmer faces an inconsistency parent points to a child but child does not exist then he would need to deal with that with his own custom code  Consider an async process to cleanup these inconsistencies Thanks 
3923,softwareengineering, I have created a library in Python that contains functions for accessing a database This is a wrapper library around a third party application database written due to the fact that the third party application does not offer a decent API Now I originally let each function open a database connection for the duration of the function call which was OK until my program logic used nested calls to the functions where I would then be calling a particular function a few thousand times This wasnt very performant Profiling this showed that the overhead was in the database connection setup  once per function call So I moved the open connection from within the functions to the module itself so that the database connection would be opened when the library module was imported This gave me an acceptable performance Now I have two questions regarding this Firstly do I need to be concerned that I am no longer explicitly closing the database connection and how could I do it explicitly with this setup Secondly does what I have done fall anywhere close to the realm of good practice and how might I otherwise approach this

3929,softwareengineering, The team im in is moving to use couchbase rather than elasticsearch DB  Now this is only an example but my question is more general  In elasticsearch you have the notion of parentchild relationships   When we move to a standard key value store we dont have these My Question Assuming I do want to enforce relationships such as  When parent is deleted all children should be deleted When child is deleted parents which had a pointer to this child should be updated Child is rather large doc so we have a pointer from parent to child  Which design would yo go with Option  Build a general layer on top of the KV store which knows to handle parent child relationships such that your programmers only need to specify relationships and your generic sophisticateddao layer will know to handle these relationships Option  Relationships should not be managed by DAO layer so the above logical layer should manage it  No generic solution each domain entity which has this relationships should write their own code in logical layer to manage this layer Option  Parents hold children in same doc  one doc both parent and children  not going to do that children are too big and there are other types of children as well more reasons I can specify if needed Option  Use specific db features  I want to avoid that so next time we migrate into a different db I wont need to face this problem yet again  A solution that will work for any KV Option  Dont move to KV store  move to a relational database or keep current dbupdated by thimothy comment this is beyond my control we will move to KV so this option is out of question There topmost preference is for speed above any db features Option  Have an async process which manages the relations so if I delete a child in our childparent example then if a client gets the parent then fetches each of child by its id it would see a child does not exist only  min later an async process will see this inconsistency and fix it in our case the client would need to decide if this inconsistency is a real error or a temporal inconsistency  This is a possible solution so named as option  however I fear that each developer would get who knows where errors and would need to decide whether this is an ok state and to ignore or not Option  Event sourcing so that I keep replaying and rerunning at least or compensating in case of a failure where parent is updated and child is not but I think this does not solve the whole thing childparent i would still have multiple commands and events and its not like one transaction right now although I would be happy to use event sourcing im not at this point maybe in future on a total refactor of codebase no immediate remedy this can give me I know that this kind of questions tend not to have a definite answer I would like to know if anyone faced this general question before and wether its best to come up with a general framework a general DAO which knows to manage these relationships or let any developer manage his own relationships Please take into consideration that giving each developer the responsibility to manage his own relations is dubious because the more developers you have the more you want to have some base infrastructures and not reinventing the wheel or being inconsistent in between teams think enterprise  However in my case im not sure I do want to build this whole architecture and layers above a KV my tendency is currently If I have a KV allow the enduserdevelopers manage by own the dependencies however this leaves too much room for each to come up with his own solution which option would you choose UPDATE I think for me the best route to go would be under the assumption of a KV store without relationships  Do not implement generic relationships layer on top of the KV store Light DAO layer Each logicalservice layer which uses the light DAO layer would need to implement the relationships in its business logic  As an appendix to that if a programmer faces an inconsistency parent points to a child but child does not exist then he would need to deal with that with his own custom code  Consider an async process to cleanup these inconsistencies Thanks

3936,softwareengineering, I have once started a MVVMWPF project which was eventually built and deployed and for that I studied a lot of the CaliburnMicro MVVM Framework The fact is I ended up not using CaliburnMicro for that and ended up implementing some MVVM concepts myself specifically just the ViewModelBase and RoutedCommand classes Now I was assigned to a somewhat larger project along the same lines a SingleUser Rich Client Offline Desktop Application so to say and I decided to use CaliburnMicro And thats where my problem begins I have read in this famous blog post whose title says that If youre using MVVM then you need a framework that  Trying to do something like MVVM without a framework is a huge amount of work Tons of duplicate code reinventing the wheel and retraining people to think differently At least with a framework you avoid the duplicate code and hopefully don’t have to reinvent the wheel – allowing you to focus on retraining people The retraining part is generally unavoidable but a framework provides plumbing code and structure making the process easier  I would agree upon first reading but my actual experience with CaliburnMicro CM in my actual application is being of cluelessness and disorientation That is the framework didnt make the process easier at all quite the opposite Reading the everrepeating examples provided by Rob Eisenberg in the rather too informal documentation and trying to infer usage patterns from the convoluted provided samples and their utterly indirect class and interface relationships where things seem to be designed to work based on sideeffects seems humanly impossible unless you are a seasoned genius sorry for the rant but I guess you know what I mean Not to mention that any abovetrivial scenario seems to involve IoC containers which is something I have never worked with and which seem to solve a problem I might not even have I dont feel like spending more project hours learning those things instead of thinking about my problem and application domains I just wanted a banana but CM gave me a gorilla IoC holding a basket of bananas Now that I am considering to move back to my homespun MVVM framework  composed only of the handful of MVVMspecific classes I actually want to implement  I would like at least to give CM a chance in case I am losing something here or just plainly doing things the wrong way out of sheer inexperience and ignorance And so the question is  There are widespread consensus that frameworks make things easier and more natural but if I happen to be experiencing quite the opposite does this mean that I shouldnt use the framework or that I am trying to learn it the wrong way Is there a clue that I shouldnt even be using a framework in the first place Or is there some right way to figure out how to use CM for simple MVVM development  
3937,softwareengineering, I am writing a web app I want users to be able to go to a URL and start a new session of my app They can Slack their friendscolleagues the URL and then everybody is in a socketconnected scenario where the originator can pose questions to the group who can answer anonymously  Right now I initialize the user type such that the person who started the session can ask the questions I was planning on the fact that going to the same URL in a different tab would not have that initialization process and therefore I could do all kinds of things differently UI etc I am starting to wonder if theres a better what the better way to do this is I would like for users to not have to log in unless at the end they want to save their results I also dont know exactly how if actual server sessions play into this  I have something that generates a random string that becomes the route of the application with each newly opened session I was hoping that would be the way to keep peoplethings separate  Im using React Redux and Socketio What I was hoping was that opening a URL in a second tab would do things like increase a counter of the number of users etc But the state is obviously not there so the two edged sword slays me and I need some type of other solution  Im using namespacing with Socketio

3953,softwareengineering, Im trying to find some opinions on best practice for returning different types of data for the same endpoint  Surprisingly I cant find much on this subject Basically I am building an API for our website which is a singlepage app  The client uses caching to store data across pages and this data is updated as necessary by the server using websockets  There are several routes that return a list of data  Each item in the list can potentially be quite large and the list itself can contain many items Since the frontend already uses caching we want to reduce the amount of unnecessary data resent to the client where possible  One option to accomplish this is to provide a way for the frontend to obtain a list of the IDs of resources for a particular request  Based on this list the client could then request the data it needs ie if a cache miss occurs This approach is interesting but it raises several questions  What if the frontend already knows it doesnt have any of the resources  Instead of requesting a list of IDs it should be able to request the data directly What is the best approach  Possible approaches and their disadvantages appear below  Question Is there an approach not listed below that seems appropriate  Is there an approach I missed that might be better  Does this seem like overkill Aproaches  Just send the data  Nuclear option  Advantages  Simplicity Return type is consistent  Disadvantages  The client may already have much of the data wasting bandwidth  Use the same route and declare a query param that determines the type of data to return  While not the worse option it does seem dirty returning different types of data from the same endpoint yes I know you can specify ContentType in requests but this header is telling the server what representation of the data is desired not really what type of data to return Advantages  The client can determine when it wants the data or just the IDs  Disadvantages  Return type depends on the value of the query param Added conditional logic  Allow for field selection   This approach follows Suggestion  on this blog Advantages Disadvantages  Added unnecessary complexity  Field selection doesnt make sense for our app  Therefore the only valid value for this param would be the ID field The format of the data depends on the query param  while the data type is technically still the same its structure is different in each request  Not something I really like  Prepend the original route with ids  Clients would be able to send a GET request to the same path they would for the actual data prepended by ids  For example instead of cars the request would be sent to idscars Advantages  Seems more semantically meaningful than just using a query param  Disadvantages  GET would be the only logical request that would ever be sent to these endpoints DRY or added conditional logic  Either a new endpoint has to be added that basically duplicates the original endpoint or the same endpoint is used with the same conditional logic necessary for point   Use a value for Accept and ContentType headers similar to applicationjsonid  This is an approach similar to the one used by LTI  The advantages and disadvantages as far as I know are the same as point  Always send just the ID  Nuclear option  Advantages  Simplicity Return type is consistent Potentially results in less data being sent to the client  Disadvantages  Since the number of resources available could be high this could result in many GET requests  if the cache is almost empty ultimately defeating the purpose of this approach Semantically less meaningful  Im making a request for the resources not their IDs

3956,softwareengineering, Having built a couple of moderately complex APIs  both in Laravel  I appreciate the value of transforming data before sending it in a response What I am struggling with is how this data should be handled when it comes back so for create and especially update methods Should it be transformed but in reverse For example say we have the following Task transformer class ContractTransformer extends Transformer             param task       return array           public function transformtask              return              id            taskid             title         tasktitle             description   taskdescription             duedate      taskenddate                 Note that the value for the column enddate in the database is returned as duedate  a primitive example of returning the column name in a more user friendly way Say we have a user consuming this API and building the front end with AngularReact or another framework they receive a value for duedate and therefore surely they would expect to send it back for an update operation as duedate rather than enddate Then we have the problem especially for large objects with many fields of having to do something like the following task  Taskfindid         tasktitle  requestinputtitle         taskdescription  requestinputdescription          and so on         tasksave  Rather than using requestall  And it means if column names change we have to update all the update methods too Is there a good way to handle this Should the data be retransformed

3962,softwareengineering, Im trying to find some opinions on best practice for returning different types of data for the same endpoint  Surprisingly I cant find much on this subject Basically I am building an API for our website which is a singlepage app  The client uses caching to store data across pages and this data is updated as necessary by the server using websockets  There are several routes that return a list of data  Each item in the list can potentially be quite large and the list itself can contain many items Since the frontend already uses caching we want to reduce the amount of unnecessary data resent to the client where possible  One option to accomplish this is to provide a way for the frontend to obtain a list of the IDs of resources for a particular request  Based on this list the client could then request the data it needs ie if a cache miss occurs This approach is interesting but it raises several questions  What if the frontend already knows it doesnt have any of the resources  Instead of requesting a list of IDs it should be able to request the data directly What is the best approach  Possible approaches and their disadvantages appear below  Question Is there an approach not listed below that seems appropriate  Is there an approach I missed that might be better  Does this seem like overkill Aproaches  Just send the data  Nuclear option  Advantages  Simplicity Return type is consistent  Disadvantages  The client may already have much of the data wasting bandwidth  Use the same route and declare a query param that determines the type of data to return  While not the worse option it does seem dirty returning different types of data from the same endpoint yes I know you can specify ContentType in requests but this header is telling the server what representation of the data is desired not really what type of data to return Advantages  The client can determine when it wants the data or just the IDs  Disadvantages  Return type depends on the value of the query param Added conditional logic  Allow for field selection   This approach follows Suggestion  on this blog Advantages Disadvantages  Added unnecessary complexity  Field selection doesnt make sense for our app  Therefore the only valid value for this param would be the ID field The format of the data depends on the query param  while the data type is technically still the same its structure is different in each request  Not something I really like  Prepend the original route with ids  Clients would be able to send a GET request to the same path they would for the actual data prepended by ids  For example instead of cars the request would be sent to idscars Advantages  Seems more semantically meaningful than just using a query param  Disadvantages  GET would be the only logical request that would ever be sent to these endpoints DRY or added conditional logic  Either a new endpoint has to be added that basically duplicates the original endpoint or the same endpoint is used with the same conditional logic necessary for point   Use a value for Accept and ContentType headers similar to applicationjsonid  This is an approach similar to the one used by LTI  The advantages and disadvantages as far as I know are the same as point  Always send just the ID  Nuclear option  Advantages  Simplicity Return type is consistent Potentially results in less data being sent to the client  Disadvantages  Since the number of resources available could be high this could result in many GET requests  if the cache is almost empty ultimately defeating the purpose of this approach Semantically less meaningful  Im making a request for the resources not their IDs   
3963,softwareengineering, Im currently looking for best practices when it comes to GitHub organizations Heres our situation Were a small research group at a university having some research projects where coding is involved Up to now each of us have used their own individual GitHub user account to manage the code theyre primarily working on We decided rather late that it would be a good idea to have an organizational account where we could put research project related stuff such that we can point to this location if needed Reasoning was that it is  a better idea to point to githubcomprojectrepo than to githubcomsomeusernamerepo and  potentially more stable as researchers usually have fixedterm contracts and may leave the intitute sooner or later but the professor who manages the organizational account will stay The problem is we are not quite sure how to deal with our previous and future work Our professor wants to fully acknowledge our intellectual property so to speak so if we would transfer our repos from our own accounts to the organization accounts we feel that we lose some milestones on our personal GitHub profiles which can be seen as a virtual CV in the world of software development Two potential solutions came to my mind  would be to have a fork either in the organization or in the user account But that would require to constantly update the fork to keep it in sync with the progress and Im not quite sure what would be the ideal solution when leaving the university  would be to set up a mirror in the organization account but Im not experienced with that and also not sure if this would be the right thing to do Also maybe I am not aware of a third solution I also want to add that I personally think that its the activity on GitHub that counts and not the number of repos you own on your user profile But I have also made a very bad experience in the past  after I have left my old university where I contributed a lot of work to a repo in a organization account some douchebag there managed to delete the whole thing He also somehow managed to delete all the commit history of his local copy so when he pushed it again to the organization account all the history of my previous commits just vanished and now it looks like he was the one working on it all alone all the time This is why I want to very carefully approach the situation at hand and do it correctly right from the start

3967,softwareengineering, For some payment methods users fill out paper forms with a digit reference ID Numerical IDs have the flaw that users can make transcription errors lost digits duplicated digits switched digits You can trivially detect those errors by adding a checksum eg modulobased from the ISO  standard But how can you avoid those errors The only way I can think of at the moment is to make the codes shorter by encoding the numeric ID in an extended alphanumeric character set But then you open another source of errors which is character similarity and OCR errors  My questions are  Is there set of characters thats big enough to create a reduction in digits but still has low error rates in OCRhuman writing We were relatively strict and came up with ACDEFKLMNPRTWXYZ Does it make a difference if we create the checksum after or before encoding The checksum itself must also be encoded so it probably makes sense to encode after checksumming Is there already a standard or a widely used implementation  At the moment our plan is to use the following steps  Create a base checksum from numeric ID with ISO  MOD  Convert base ID and base checksum to a base number base because ACDEFKLMNPRTWXYZ is  chars long Map the two base numbers which use  and AL as digits to our set of  characters  Is there any better way

3989,softwareengineering, I have always heard that linear search is a naive approach and binary search is better than it in performance due to better asymptotic complexity But I never understood why is it better than linear search when sorting is required before binary search Linear search is On and binary search is Olog n That seems to be the basis of saying that binary search is better But binary search requires sorting which is On log n for the best algorithms So binary search shouldnt be actually faster as it requires sorting I am reading CLRS in which the author implies that in insertion sort instead of using the naive linear search approach it is better to use binary search for finding the place where item has to be inserted  In this case this seems to be justified as at each loop iteration there is a sorted list over which the binary search can be applied But in the general case where there is no guarantee about the data set in which we need to search isnt using binary search actually worse than linear search due to sorting requirements Are there any practical considerations that I am overlooking which make binary search better than linear search Or is binary search considered better than linear search without considering the computation time required for sorting 
3990,softwareengineering, Lately i have been taking an course at brilliantorg i was exploring a lesson on QuickSort algorithm found a question Which of the following would provide the optimal pivot selection at each step of quicksort  A The element in the first position   B The element with the smallest value   C A randomly selected element   D The median of the elements  The answer listed was D  but in real life arrays how is it going to be any of the options above Justification listed was  the median value will allow the algorithm to split the list into approximately equal parts so the runtime will speed up We never know the value of a element if we do choose a median how is it guaranteed to make the array split into  parts  For all we know it may turn out of be the highest or lowest or very near to the highest or the lowest number Which would make either of the left array or right array almost empty

4119,stats, I am trying to see how different variables have consistently measure urban condition or performance My variable list includes  population  per capita income  labor force participation rate  unemployment rate  crime rate  median housing value etc for major cities In order to compare those variables I standardized these variables and created Zscore for each variable Our research question is to find out whether these variables are consistently measuring urban condition  I am told I need to do an Internal consistency analysis calculating Cronbachs Alpha But I am a bit confused because I thought it is mainly used for survey questions and this is basically a test of its reliability for survey questionnaire Can I use Cronbachs alpha for above variables which is not developed to measure the same phenomenon  Then if I want to know which variables are more correlated to each other or can be explained by common factors can I conduct factor analysis I am wondering whether factor analysis is only used for Likert scale measurements I hope my question is clear  
4120,stats, I am using httpscikitlearnorgstablemodulesgeneratedsklearnensembleGradientBoostingRegressorhtml to fit a gradient boosting model GBM built on regression trees  I am using quantile loss with alpha ie my loss function is mean absolute error MAE The optimal model with this loss function is the conditional median textmedianY X where Y denotes the predicted variable and X is a vector of covariates Very rarely I have seen predictions that are outside of the range seen in the models training data  For example the Y in my training data might lie in   and very rarely I see predictions with hatY   Is this theoretically possible with GBMs or should I suspect that there is a bug in my code andor in sklearn Assuming I understand random forests RFs correctly it should be impossible for this to happen with a RF because the predicted values are all means  medians depending on whether one uses absolute error or squared error loss of subsets of the training data But GBMs are different from RFs and this argument does not carry over Are predictions outside the range of the training data theoretically possible with GBMs

4122,stats, Im trying to calculate the probability that p or more columns of an n x m matrix each element of which can have q values will be identical The value of elements are assigned randomly with equal probability  So for instance elements of the n x m  x  matrix below can have any of q  different values p  columns have identical values What is the probability that p or more columns had identical values     a   c   t   g   a   a   c    a   t   t   c   c   c   a    a   a   t   a   g   a   g    a   t   t   c   a   a   c    a   t   t   g   a   c   g     So far my logic is  The probability that any column wont have identical values is  fracqleftn  right  There are fracmleftmpright p ways to have mp columns that dont match    The npickk formula is usually written fracnk leftn  kright In my example we replace n with the number of columns m and k with mp because we want to know how many ways there are to not have matching values  The probability that mp columns wont have matching values is therefore  leftfracqleftn right  right leftmpright  This cant be right though The example above in which  columns have the same value is not terribly likely But the formula I wrote evaluates to  left frac right left right    which must be way too high   leftfracqleftn right  right leftmpright  gives me numbers that seem reasonable but I cant justify why that would be the right equation

4133,stats, I want to perform Oneway analysis with permutation test In this link I found online some instructions how to proceed in R In that tutorial the example data set has equal sample sizes by factor   I was wondering to apply similar approach with  unequal sample sizes by factors  I believe that in this situation some sort of control of differences in sampling effort has to be accounted avoiding run the analysis with unequal samples sizes Also Im think is necessary avoid throwing data away and loss information  To deal with this problems I wish to use a kind of rarefaction approach  to accomplish this task equating the effort by factors without loosing information To do so one could apply multiple runs of analysis as I will try to describe below In the unequal example the factor A has only five observations so in RUN we rarefy all the other factors to only five random selected observations too equating efforts  Note a pseudp value for RUN This value could be calculated with independencetest function from package coin using permutation procedures from the tutorial cited before  The next step is repeat the rarefaction of observations from factors B and C selecting five observations by factor and calculating another pseudo p value from RUN to RUN  In the end I wish to calculate one mean using all  calculated pseudo p values Since this procedure is repeated many many times the information from all observations contributes to the final p value This unified p value will be used to make inferences   If this unified p value be significant I wish also to apply the same rarefaction procedure on a posthoc test using the headtail function from FSA package See the tutorial cited before Now the questions Since both functions independencetestheadtail already do permutation is correct to do what I described above In other words is correct to add anothers layers of permutation procedures  If question  is correct does someone knows any paper or book that apply identical or similar approach   rarefaction is a procedure widely used in biodiversity analysis to deal with distinct numbers of sampling units individuals or frequencies between factorstreatmentslink   Note that all five observations values from factor B and C are presented on the original dataset on which B has ten observations and C has fifteen  p values only for illustration not actually calculated

4151,stats, I have been using Rs glmnet for training elastic net models for both regression and classification problems In glmnet you have to set the parameter family as familybinomial for binary classification tasks and familygaussian for regression tasks This is very much in line with the theory as the cost function for regression and that for classification differs a lot the cost function of regression is primarily dependent on the difference between predicted and actual quantitative value whereas the cost function for classification from the context of logistic regression is based on sigmoid function and log values  In scikitlearn the corresponding function for building Elastic Net model is ElasticNetCV and there is no mention of selecting a loss function or something which is intuitively similar to the usage of glmnet for classification problems It looks like scikitlearns ElasticNetCV can only be used for regression tasks in the strict sense But I have seen many people using the same for classification tasks as well Is this a valid practice

4161,stats, So I have this table with clinical info  independent variable and  dependent to analyze and Im looking into a particular set of analysis that has been giving me trouble Id like the most complete way of comparing all  of them as a whole between groups My data has  independent variable Gender and  columns with YesNo variables There are a total of  rows another set of tests Im doing involves  rows with approximately   distribution of the group MaleFemale Simplified example of my dataframe is as follows for R table  dataframex  cMale Female Male                           y  cYes No No z  cYes No Yes                           t  cNo Yes Yes  All of these dependent variables y z t are possible triggers for a disease and are not exclusive between them ie a patient can have multiple triggers several triggers can be present Yes I did create a variable with a simple sum of all the triggers into a numeric one and applied a KruskallWallis test  given nonnormality of data not too many people with  triggers though I really wanted that would give a more broad view on the distribution of multiple variables Even plotting a graph doesnt seem as easy would not as easy as it would imply several counts for the same subject unless plotting for each variable My main question is How youd you go about comparing multiple dependent binary variables triggers in this case between groups I have done fisher tests linear regression and logistic regression and would like to know what am I doing wrong basically That and which one would be best in this case I have done multiple Fisher tests which I believe is ok as the  dependent variables do not really depend on each other for the purpose of this analysis This doesnt however give me a clear picture of the distribution of the triggers per group And its quite a bit of work to do multiple analysis rather than just  or  I also did linear regression transformed variables as Yes Noas well as logistic regression in an attempt to quickly identify significantly different variables across Groups That led me to this post What follows is the Pvalues table per modelfisher  Row  is intercept and empty data in fisher column GLMLM is GLM without specifying link function which replicated LM hence same values GLMlabeled column was a GLM with familybinomiallinklogit fitted All were modeled as y   I thought it best to apply simple LM to get a view on all pvalues then confirmed a significant pvalue with fisher for row  though GLM reported a pvalue of  But then I went to perform another fisher test for row  and it was far off the significance achieved in both the GLM and LM Would you recommend me doing a Fisher test a full table of contigency  columns Male Female and YesNo counts per row Andor multiple fisher tests  each original dataframe column Or logistic regression Or linear model Given the nonnormality of data Im inclined to think multiple fisher tests would be the more appropriate but I though a logistic regression would be useful in this case Though even when running a logistic regression with just the variable in row  of the image as dependent I still get pvalue   while fisher is pvalue   Thanks

4305,tex, Im trying to make an animation to show how to find the median of a small list of numbers As I would incorporate it into a presentation I used beamer frames but Im open to alternatives I used tikz because I usually like the output of tikz pictures  Ive hit some difficulties I built the frames one by one so the approach is tedious and doesnt scale up well I tried a for loop but didnt get there Because of my lack of familiarity with tikz boxes move around a bit and the numbers get misaligned It would be great to fix the wobbling and have a loop that would make it possible to generate an animation for other sets of numbers I also had a plan to add a little bubble at the end to explain that the median of an even list of numbers is by convention taken to be the mean of the last two numbers in the middle but thats still a todo Now I dont think my animation is too ugly but I dont think its too pretty either so feel free to use your aesthetic judgement if you see obvious improvements    So we have a sorted list and cancel out the extremes two by two until   My lame code PassOptionsToPackageusenamesdvipsnamessvgnamesxcolor documentclassptbeamer   setbeamertemplatenavigation symbols   setbeamertemplateheadline   setbeamertemplatefootline  usepackagetikz usetikzlibraryshapesmisc newcommandcrossoutraiseboxmm     tikzdraw nodeanchorwest inner sepptcross         drawcross out red line widthptcrossnorth west  crosssouth east         drawcross out red line widthptcrosssouth west  crossnorth east       newcommandselectedraiseboxmm     tikzbaselinecenterbase nodedrawrectangleblueline widthptinner seppt center   usepackagemathtools usepackageempheq usepackagemanytcolorbox tcbsethighlight math styleenhanced   colframeredblackcolbackyellowwhitearcptboxrulept     newcommandshspacept begindocument beginframe beginempheqboxtcbhighmathalign  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  endempheq endframe  beginframe beginempheqboxtcbhighmathalign crossout s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s crossout endempheq endframe  beginframe beginempheqboxtcbhighmathalign crossout s crossout s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s crossout s crossout endempheq endframe  beginframe beginempheqboxtcbhighmathalign crossout s crossout s crossout s  s  s  s  s  s  s crossout s crossout s crossout endempheq endframe  beginframe beginempheqboxtcbhighmathalign crossout s crossout s crossout s crossout s  s  s  s  s crossout s crossout s crossout s crossout endempheq endframe  beginframe beginempheqboxtcbhighmathalign crossout s crossout s crossout s crossout s crossout s  s  s crossout s crossout s crossout s crossout s crossout endempheq endframe  beginframe beginempheqboxtcbhighmathalign crossout s crossout s crossout s crossout s crossout selected s  crossout s crossout s crossout s crossout s crossout endempheq endframe  enddocument

4314,tex, Previously LyX worked perfectly with the images in the final output PDF being in lovely and perfect vector form  However I recently formatted my hard disk and reinstalled LyX I then tried outputting a PDF file from the exact same LyX and EMF files However now the images in the output PDF are rasterizedpixelizedfuzzy Not surprisingly I prefer the first version vector Please let me know what I should do to fix this  I have tried fiddling with the EMF to EPS converter settings but these havent worked What Ive tried  Under Tools  Preferences  File Handling  Converters  Enhanced Metafile  EPS   Changed convert to magick  Remove density  Unchecking the Converter File Cache Enabled box   How these EMF files were produced I draw my graphs in Microsoft Excel first I select the graph copy CtrlC then paste CtrlV into LyX LyX then converted these into EMF files which were saved in the same folder as the LyX file So these EMF files were from before I formatted my hard disk I dont know if that matters When formatting my HD I backed up my files on an external HD and now Ive copied them back

4353,tex, Id like to be able to use a tool like grep to extract an entire bibtex reference rather than just the matching line For example grep Smith mydatabasebib would return lines that contain the word Smith Id like to have a commandline program that returned the entire bibtex reference that encloses the word Smith  How can this be done on the commandline  In particular Id be interested in whether there is a way of using sed or awk to perform the task

4355,tex, Inspired by an answer to another question I am reminded of the various reasons why its difficult to have only one BIB file I would like to have a set of command line tools that I could script to take my master BIB and convert it for a specific situation I am aware of bibtool which is probably powerful enough that it can meet most of my needs but I havent figured out how to use it Here are some common tasks that could be automated this way Of course the strategic goal would be solved the right way by using a smarter BST or something like biblatex but often one is constrained or at least it is much more convenient to use a publishers broken BST and make a few tweaks to the database  Truncate all papers with more than  authors and keep only the first  authors of any truncated papers because you are running low on space Remove a field month url ISSN ISBN because a journal has a broken BST that makes a mess of these  Remove a field conditionally eg remove title only for articles but not books Expandcollapse string references eg I have  files one apsjourbib with STRINGprl  Phys Rev Lett and one fulljourbib with STRINGprl  Physical Review Letters so I can write bibliographyapsjourarticlebib or bibliographyfulljourarticlebib as required but I certainly dont expect my coauthors to deal with this convention Remove archiveprefix eprint primaryclass from articles with a page number Remove DOIs with weird characters in them because the documentclass doesnt do enough escaping seriously Wiley is SICIAIDPROPCO really a good idea for something that needs to end up in a URL A tool that is flexible enough to do more sophisticated things would be nice so long as the flexibility isnt at the price of usability cf bibtool There are probably other use cases that Ive temporarily forgotten I feel like Im forever making journalspecific or even paperspecific modifications of bibtex databases JabRef makes it fairly easy but still  There are lots of cute tools living on CTAN in texarchivebibliobibtexutils but I feel that there must be some other place where the serious tools hide I cant be the only one with these problems can I Feel free to tell me that Im approaching this the wrong way and let me know your personal strategy for dealing with the above issues without using commandline tools This includes as Jukka Suomela suggests in his answer tools for editing the generated BBL file instead of editing the BIB Here are some problems that I already know of solutions for  Process an AUX file to keep only the cited entries many solutions including bibextract Merge BIB files and remove duplicates pybib Force a particular format of page ranges  or  bibfilereformatpages

4361,travel, Here is a situation I encountered multiple times in New York City streets lately Usually at a sidewalk corner where people are likely to wait for the pedestrian crossing walk signal a gang of two three four people are present One of them hands a CD in a plastic pocket supposedly a prerelease brand new rap album of the guy The way he wants you to take the CD is rather aggressive Another man of the gang does the same thing even asking for your name and writing it on the plastic pocket They even give you extra CDs makes no sense The trouble comes when they all start asking for money talking about a donation It begins by   and it seems very difficult to say no as the guys do not want to take the CDs back As they look physically in good shape and likely to have regular workouts at the gym they appear impressive and the idea of getting into an argument is just out of the question In the process of taking the money out of the wallet to pay the forced donation when I was caught in that scheme I accidentally let them see a  bill in my wallet They wanted it right away and gave me minimal change out of it as it is for their friends too How can one escape this situation safely without giving out any money Note for duplicates This situation even if similar to the string scam used in other cities is unique due to the approach of someone looking friendly and the realistic expectation to discover new music And such people are rather difficult to calculate on first sight Furthermore I was not aware of similar schemes with different objects used before living the scam for real

4371,travel, I’m living in Cambridge Massachusetts One night a man approached me on my way out of a restaurant in Inman Square It was around  pm of a weekday the streets were starting to get lonely but weren’t deserted and I was alone In case this is relevant I’m a male burglars and scammers target males and females differently and a foreigner who speaks with some accent This man tried to engage in conversation with me asking if the pizza place I’ve just left was any good I was caught off guard and answered his entry question and he proceeded to tell me about his friends his family and stuff people you just met wouldn’t be interested in Then I realized the man seemed nervous and fidgeted with his hands At that moment I sensed something sketchy was happening and started walking seeking shelter in an open store No matter I was walking at a fast pace he followed me by my side Meanwhile I keep the conversation going with plain yeses noes and other evasive answers I assumed he may have gotten angry if I stopped replying but wanted to make clear I wasn’t interested in talking I was unlucky and couldn’t find any place to hide so I had to walk with him for more than two streets Finally he said “Hey That’s my car Do you need a ride” I politely said “No thanks anyway” and kept walking No way I was getting into his car He got into his car and drove away and I was left like “What the F just happened” I checked my pockets luckily everything was in there and made the rest of my way home unscratched So my question is was I going to be subject of crime Is this any sort of scam scheme or am simply being paranoid about friendly Americans in the street

4383,travel, Ive taken my fiancée to Paris twice  first for our st anniversary and again for our th  and both times we had troubles with guys bothering us around the Sacré Coeur in Montmartre They hang around the front entrance to the park and pester tourists with some sort of strange scheme involving tying string to peoples fingers From what  I can tell anyone whos ensnared by the trick ends up being pestered into buying a bit of wool for a few euros Often we managed to get past them immediately by saying no but in some cases they were persistent and in a few cases they continually grabbed us and continued to shout at us after we escaped In one case I had to physically pull one of them off my fiancée as he was gripping her arm tightly and trying to tie string to her hand Not exactly enjoyable when were trying to have a relaxing holiday In the end we resorted to walking up the long set of stairs to the left of the park and coming back down through the top entrance which was exhausting and left us uncomfortable in the heat One thing I noticed is that the police periodically appear and the sellers run off or hide down side roads In once case we were treated to the sight of three armed officers chasing after one of them and tackling him to the ground much the the enjoyment of everyone watching So whats the deal with these guys Are they breaking the law by being there Whats the best way to deal with them We love everything about Paris especially the Sacré Coeur but these guys are an annoyance wed prefer to avoid

4553,ux, I am very new to web design I hacked a template for a simple page that has images on the left and text on the right My site works well for websized browsers but it does not align for mobileminimized windows Behavior of the original site when minimized the image goes on top text goes on bottom Behavior of my site when minimized the image remains on the left and text remains on the right so I need to scroll right to read it  The problem does not seem to be with html but with helper css and js files Which ones do you know of that help with table alignments 
4554,ux, I remember in the early days of the Internet one of the most prominent things on a website was the visitor counter These days with so much analytics and obsession about how many people visit or follow websites I wonder how the site counter gradually disappeared from the web page Can anyone offer an explanation or suggestion

4556,ux, This is in regards to every lock that turns degrees Meaning not combination locks and unconventional locks Lets just restrict it to  Deadlocks Door locks The keyhole on the other side of a door lock keyholes in general  I guess this is two questions  Which way is locked Vertical or horizontal Which way locks Clockwise or counterclockwise  Ive seen doorknobs have all sorts of configurations of this so it never feels natural to lock or unlock someone elses door The best thing for UX would be to have it be consistent across all locks Are locks mostly consistent in these configurations or not 
4557,ux, I have a problem building a certain UI for a website Im going to demonstrate the problem with a simple website for a restaurant chain   Context the website has many users and many restaurants Each restaurant has certain users assigned to it where the user could be either a manager a cook or a waiter the waiter can see the addresses of the orders that come in the cook can see that and the content of the orders what the food is and the manager can see both these things and can change the roles of any user There can only be one manager for every restaurant but as many cooks and waiters as desired Heres how the UI looks like as of now  download bmml source – Wireframes created with Balsamiq Mockups Problem Users can only have one role each since every role has all the privileges of the previous roles plus a new privilege So no one can be both a waiter and a cook or a cook and a manager etc That isnt very clear using the UI above since one could check two checkboxes for the same user or even all three roles Question How do you you make this idea clear through the UI the idea being the there can only be one manager for a restaurant and every user can have only one role This is my first post here by the way so I hope Im in the right place Thanks for responses in advance EDIT There are higher roles that can change all three mentioned roles freely  The last case is what Im trying to avoid Mary  
4558,ux, I have a map with locations coming from a user Sometimes these are sparse  location every  meters and sometimes dense many locations every  meters I have them plotted on a map similar to this  However in my application they arent always paths from A to B Sometimes it is the person leaving home going for a drive and then coming back again This causes the route to basically be a circle sometimes the route home is the same as the route out but they dont overlap exactly  different side of road Id like to be able to show the direction travelled on the map One option is to draw arrows but that isnt always possible Consider this  If Im in a dense region then Ill either draw many arrows and they will overlap and be very messy Alternatively if I draw no arrows in dense areas there may be a very long distance between arrow draws Are there best practices for this type of thing An app that shows direction travelled particularly well 
4559,ux, I am faced with little headache  I have a modal dialog px that can have this one huge column To top things off the text can be unlimited Some ideas that I thought of are   adding an icon and proving the text on popover adding this column as a new line inside each line below the rest of the cells adding ellipsis and giving the full text on rollover in a tooltip or popover  Any input is greatly appreciated thanks

4590,ux, I have a map with locations coming from a user Sometimes these are sparse  location every  meters and sometimes dense many locations every  meters I have them plotted on a map similar to this  However in my application they arent always paths from A to B Sometimes it is the person leaving home going for a drive and then coming back again This causes the route to basically be a circle sometimes the route home is the same as the route out but they dont overlap exactly  different side of road Id like to be able to show the direction travelled on the map One option is to draw arrows but that isnt always possible Consider this  If Im in a dense region then Ill either draw many arrows and they will overlap and be very messy Alternatively if I draw no arrows in dense areas there may be a very long distance between arrow draws Are there best practices for this type of thing An app that shows direction travelled particularly well

4604,ux, Im creating a mobile application sticking to Material Design guidelines and components for the most part In that application I want the user to select a group and then get some detailed info on that group The group info is displayed below the selector component so you can do a selection any time The groups are numbered consecutively I want those groups to be as easy to select as possible because most of the time the users will want the last groups and Ill probably default to the first group Thats why I want to create a component that allows instant selection of whatever option The group labels are going to be  digits repeated Group feels awful so I feel like a MD dropdown is a waste of space and the options will feel empty lacking something as they are very spacious and meant to be used with long labels  So I thought that segmented control would be a good idea But it turned out that the buttons were pretty small on a mobile screen  choices in a single row splitting it into more rows also kind of doesnt appeal So my thoughts circled around something that looks like an MD seekbar but without the progress part to the left of the handle   And still Im not satisfied I feel like this is an entirely different component that has a different meaning But at least it should work well on a small screen as it is easy to drag the handle around What option should I choose Am I even on the right track with this and are these final options appropriate

4614,ux, Im designing an application with a bottom navigation in one of the views the user may click on a floating action button which opens a page containing a form to fill this page the form page Im referring to does not have the bottom navigation on it Is it confusing if I use a persistent bottom sheet on this page as long as the user can add rows or attach something or other actions that are related to this form as the persistent bottom sheets are to display content equal in value to the primary content as google states  Of course the icons on bottom navigation and persistent bottom sheet are different so it wont be a confusion due to similar icons Heres an example of what Im trying to reach on the form page googlecomforms but its on the web

4628,vi, Id like to optimize my find and replace workflow in Vim Its something I do often as Im sure most of you do too Usually something along the lines of  copy a block and change the name of a variable in a few places I know I know that probably triggers your why are you copying and pasting code reflex but lets not go down that road There are plenty of valid use cases  Im well aware of the search and replace commands s or s but I dont like them It forces me to type out both the full variable name Im searching for and what Im changing it to Maybe there is a better way fix the the amount of typing with s I often use long descriptive variable names so that is really a deal breaker for me I also dont like how typing out a variable name from scratch is typo prone and can consume time and brainpower hunting down typos I much prefer typing it once and then copying and pasting to just avoid this entirely if possible My current workflow uses some combination of movementyankselectsearchput to move around the file and replace one by one It is not great but has the benefit of avoiding typing out full variable names I might just need to type the first few letters with  or use another movement command ie fx depending on whats around and then hit ve to select the whole word I also dont mind that I have to repeat for every instance I never do a full find replace without confirming each change But it would be much preferable if I could repeat the replacement action with a single keystroke which I cant do with this method each replacement is usually something like n then ve then p or even worse p Is there a faster way

4643,vi, There is something I cannot do with YouCompleteMe that I could do when just using tags to navigate to a definition or declaration The desired behaviour is taking into account that  is my leader key  g should attempt to go to the definitiondeclaration in the current buffer If changes to the buffer are not saved it should print an error No write since last change or something similar and do nothing ds should open the definitiondeclaration in a vertical split regardless of whether changes to the current buffer have been saved or not since the original buffer will remain open dt should open the definitiondeclaration in a new tab regardless of whether changes to the current buffer have been saved or not since the original buffer will remain open  With ctags behaviour  was the standard Ctrl and  and  could be achieved with  Open definition in new vertical split map leaderds vsp CRexectag expandcwordCR  Open definition in new tab map leaderdt tab splitCRexectag expandcwordCR  However YouCompleteMe seems to behave differently According to the official documentation  The gycmgotobuffercommand option Defines where GoTo commands result should be opened Can take one of   the following values  samebuffer horizontalsplit   verticalsplit newtab neworexistingtab  If this option is   set to the samebuffer but current buffer can not be switched when   buffer is modified and nohidden option is set then result will be   opened in horizontal split  This means that if I define my new mappings as  Shortcuts for navigating to definitions using YouCompleteMe map leaderg  YcmCompleter GoToDefinitionElseDeclarationCR  Open definition in new vertical split map leaderds vsp CRexecYcmCompleter GoToDefinitionElseDeclarationCR  Open definition in new tab map leaderdt tab splitCRexecYcmCompleter GoToDefinitionElseDeclarationCR  I cant achieve any of the behaviours if the changes to the file have not been saved  g does not print an error but instead opens the definitiondeclaration in a new horizontal split ds does not open the definitiondeclaration in the new split directly but instead creates the vertical split and then opens the definitiondeclaration in a horizontal split inside the vertical split dt does not open the definitiondeclaration in the new tab directly but instead creates the new tab and then opens the definitiondeclaration in a horizontal split inside the tab  What settingsmappings should I set to achieve the desired behaviour

4719,workplace, Im set to graduate in Computer Engineering this year As part of the requirements to graduate I have to develop submit and present a capstone project to the faculty Im allowed to choose whatever project I want as long as the faculty approves it While I have a year and a half to finish it and many students do take that long My goal is to deliver it in time for the next graduation date available At the same time Ive been working at a software company that has just closed a deal to develop a system that requires significant research in machine learning Being aware of the capstone project requirement and that Im still looking for a project my boss strongly insisted that I should pick it up He even offered to personally advise me I get to name up to  advisers and get me whatever resources I might need Since I was curious about it I asked him to send me some material to read and decide However while studying the material I noticed  red flags  Ill need to spend hundreds of hours studying to learn new skills on top of building and then documenting it well enough for the final paper to be understandable and thorough as it will be required by the faculty It is nearly impossible for me to finish it within the year The architecture points to a system that will require multiple people sharing the research and workload required to build it When I asked him about it he told me his plan was to fit my project into a much larger one In fact he is already assembling a team across multiple universities to tackle the challenge including himself whos joining a grad program next year and planning to work on it for the next  years The issue I have with it is that my project was supposed to be a solo project and evaluated only by the faculty Instead the prospect is to have several grad students supervising criticizing and determining the overall direction of what Ill be doing   While Im happy to put in the hours required to learn design and build such a system and also dont mind working on a team to achieve it I dont want it to be my capstone project It is far above whats expected from an undergrad student it would significantly postpone my graduation and I would have to relinquish control over my project   So my questions are  As an employee what are the potential consequences if I were to refuse his terms  How can I communicate that despite appreciating the offer and willing to accept it as a work project I want my capstone project to be something more personal and smaller in scope  Additional information  My boss is aware of all capstone requirements since he is just a few years my senior His proposal as it currently stands already fulfills all of them By claiming it is far above whats expected from an undergrad student I meant that significantly smaller projects are consistently approved by the faculty some of them awarded with the maximum grade Every capstone project has to be approved by a professor However it is extremely unlikely I find a professor that would reject this project unless they hold some personal grudge against him In any case he has already contacted a faculty member that approved it As I mentioned previously he is going to be a grad student at the same school Im graduating from and we would have the same adviser  We have not discussed yet any work schedules It is not clear to me what his expectations are in terms of weekly hours That being said I dont expect to be paid overtime if I choose to accept his suggestion as my capstone since it is not a practice in this culture even if that time would be spent at the office In general students who develop capstone projects within their companies just chalk it up to study hours

4755,workplace, I had recent interview that was definitely a bitsurprising I know companies interview more than one person for a position but when I showed up I saw two other people I thought well this is normal as they were moving fast and didnt want to invite each candidate separately  Well to my surprise they called all three of us into a meeting room where we saw four interviewers We all sat and interviewed together not individually We were all asked the same questions and it was just very bizarre Usually each candidate is called and interviewed separately It almost felt like we were trying to out due each other Does this occur frequently with some companies where the interview all at once

4757,workplace, How would you deal with your manager if he doesn’t see the company’s cultural problems and tries to convince you to behave passiveaggressive Let me explain the situation I’m a software engineer and we do peer code reviews in the team Sometimes I get nitpicking comments and refuse to make changes with constructive feedback In reply my colleagues insist on their nitpicks they even admit that they are nitpicking for very long time about  hours In the end I become told that  minutes caused triggered frustration and  hours discussion But wait I’m frustrated and have wasted an enormous amount of time as well It even has happened with a team lead he allowed himself to ignore my feedback and kept resisting to change anything for  hours Should not he value his my and company’s time and stop such discussions I have talked to my manager about this situation He mentioned that Personal Development would help me dramatically And he advised to ignore nitpicks and keep working saying it would help me to think positively But I do tell reviewers explicitly why I’m not ignoring their comments and why I don’t want to take them into account It prevents me from keeping unsaid thoughts inside and sets a barrier between me and nitpicking I believe nobody wants to have nitpicks It seems my manager does not want to see the whole picture He does not want to find the root of problems and fix it He sees me “complaining” and thinks that I should be fixed instead I believe he is afraid of the whole picture because he himself causes a part of toxic energy floating in our company’s culture Allowing it to exist everyone picks up these waves and takes out on each other How would you explain this to your manager 
4758,workplace, Im a software developer and interaction designer In late  I was approached by a startup for some UX work Long story short in late  I became a coownershareholder The product has a lot of potential But as of yet we havent made any money Our business model is a subscriptionbased SaaSapplication That application is exactly our main problem One of our shareholders lets call him David owns a software development business Two of his employees have been working parttime on the application for about five years now There are a lot of major issues  The application is still not in production we havent shipped anything in five years The application is buggy fragile untested unmaintainable hard to change and overall poorly made A big ball of mud so to say David and his employees are mostly unable to meet deadlines David knows the intricacies of the product quite well The same cannot be said for his employees They repeatedly make poor design decisions based on incorrect assumptions Since David and his team is very busy working on other projects they can spend eight manhours a week on the application  The success of our business greatly depends on having a functioning application that meets current and future requirements As you can imagine all shareholders are disappointed with Davids results Clearly something needed to happen Two months ago without discussing it with any of the coowners I started developing the application myself From scratch Im already about  towards a shippable application at this point Thanks to Davids efforts I know exactly what I need to build I have the luxury to start from a clean slate and being able to work  to  hours a week on developing the application Two weeks ago I informed the founder of our company He was very surprised but also happy and satisfied with my decision and results so far He told me we would need to break the news to David and the rest as soon as possible We have arranged a meeting with David which is scheduled for next week Whats the best way to inform David How should I break the news to him My intuition tells me to emphasize on the positive effects for David and the rest of our team After all David will benefit from a functioning application too even if he didnt write the code He also doesnt have to spend his already limited resources on it So it is good news for him on multiple levels On the other hand it might hurt his ego He might see himself as a loser which he isnt He might feel betrayed He might feel that he will lose control which is of course true So he has a lot of reasons to be happy but it wouldnt surprise me if he would be angry or disappointed or insert negative emotion I think its good to also emphasize on the extent in which he stays involved with the company in the future He could be a valuable sparring partner code reviewer or something else Also Im not going to take the credit he earned away from him Again thanks to him the product is welldefined and I can sail smoothly because I know exactly what needs to be built Again whats the best way to approach this Are there things I need to be aware about

4770,workplace, Under our previous manager we maybe had a staff meeting once a month If we were lucky  Under our new manager she wants to do a  minute staff meeting each Monday Which is fantastic and I love it  However I bring up topics for the agenda each week because our manager has a new way to do almost each and everything and Im trying to get us all on the same page Otherwise were all lost and our reports look like theyve been shredded despite still being in the computer Lately when someone brings up the staff meeting and asks me if I have topics and I answer in the affirmative it starts almost constant comments of Im calling off or looks like I know when to schedule my lunch or the ever popular good God why My manager doesnt tend to address anything my supervisor has maybe one thing and the other Lead wants to talk about her love life Nobody hardly answers my emails or immediately shoots my ideas down without allowing any discussion which goes against what my new manager said she was looking to create an open meeting where we could discuss new ideas solve various problems and discuss the overall Office life and how we could better improve it My previous manager took issue with a lot of things and didnt allow any defense I have RBF where my face either looks angry or disinterested when I am probably thinking about lunch or whatever bland thing and employees would accuse me of being out to get them because I either spoke in monotone and didnt realize it or glanced in their general vicinity It sounds like a horrible plot to a crappy TV drama I know I get it but I could post my file entries if you like Its hard to not take it personally especially if Im not sure whether it IS personal How can I get us all on the same page How can I approach this

4772,workplace, I went in for a technical job interview with a small company where they described the process as speaking with two or three groups of people for about  hour each They mentioned that they liked everyone in the tech group to meet candidates to get a feel for them  Everyone was friendly and it started great The first group asked general background questions as well as some straight forward technical questions and white board programming  Very much the usual but also some subjective stuff  They then left me alone while they went to another part of their office to find the other interviewers At this point the HR contact that originally greeted me came and informed me that the others were quite busy and wouldnt be able to meet  This seemed odd of course The interview was over and they would be in touch about potential next steps showing me out  I asked if theyd like to reschedule with the other interviewers but he said theyd discuss it  As I left I knew there wouldnt be next steps and a few days later this was confirmed over email Obviously not all interviews go well and not all candidates fit  Is it however professional to end an interview abruptly midway if the first part isnt ideal  What if the later parts provided some additional info to offset the first interviewers judgement 
4773,workplace, I work in a metropolitan city Most employees are permanent protected by a strong union and hard to fire I am a temporary employee and I have been working in the same team for several years  A few months ago an employee from another team that sits next to ours came up to me and said that I should cut off my hair and give it to children with cancer While I feel sorry for children suffering from cancer and their family it doesnt mean women should have to cut off all their hair  At first I tried joking it off because I was really taken aback by what he said A few days ago the same coworker came up to me and told me again to cut off my hair and give it to make wigs for children with cancer Again I tried to deflect the conversation and joke it off  I really dont want to file any complaints because   Its a waste of time I enjoy my work and get value from the tasks  It seems the person making the complaint would get vilified somehow The coworker may not realize his wrong behavior and wont stop  How do I make this stop Is there anything I can do proactively or is it wait and watch 
4774,workplace, I work in Italy In my office  people there are several coffee machines that work either by using coins or by using a precredited magnetic key These machines dont give back the eventual change so it is pretty common to use magnetic keys to save money on that A coffee is € when paying with cash but with the key it is discounted to € I decided not to buy one of those keys because I am a consultant and Im not sure how long Ill remain working in this office Since I entered the office I saw that this is a practice of my team  to meet in front of the machine where someone uses their key to buy a round of coffee theres usually a goodnatured fight to pay for the coffee This kind of habit is pretty common with my friends I do it as well but maybe in a bar and not in a professional place The first day I came to the office I decided to take the offer of a free coffee as it is pretty common to offer it to a newcomer in the team But on other days I feel awkward taking a free coffee without contributing to the cost The coffee machines do not take bills so Im also not able to offer the coffee back to others since as stated I dont have the credit key nor do I carry enough coins What should I do Should I buy a credit key and offer the coffee to other team members in the same way as the others do Or should I just pay for my own coffee and take my breaks at different times

4867,worldbuilding, Background Say there is a country that is ruled by a king medieval era style It rules over several cities and towns maintaining control with a national guard Now lets say within the boundaries of this country but close to the border is a city that has rejected the monarchy and rules itself There is no established government in this city and no leaders There are several gangs large and small ones that operate on an honor based system There are people that are not within a gang like inn owners etc but most people have an unofficial affiliation with at least one faction Each of the gangs understand that if they were to fight with each other constantly no one would benefit So grievances are hashed out in a fighting pit This can be between individuals within gangs or entire gangs pitted against each other There is a lot of crime in this city as there are no official laws but there are a set of rules people are expected to adhere to no stealing and no murder included If these rules are broken they get thrown into jail without a trial Once the jail is full the individual prisoners fight it out in the pit and the last one surviving gets freed It is a flawed system as the strongest survive even after multiple infractions and gangs tend not to rat out their own very often but it has kept the peace between gangs for many years and everyone accepts it Most of the larger gangs have chapters in cities around the country that still come under the reign of the king The monarchy accepts their presence as none of the gangs are large enough to pose a threat to the throne individually but if they combined they might overthrow the entire country So it is in their best interest to have them pitted against each other rather than join forces The gangs offer services to people and businesses from basic mercenary work like protecting trade caravans between towns to basic farm labor at the harvest to assassinations by the less reputable gangs  Question How would the lawless city function at an economic level Could earning money from the separate chapters and funneling it to this town provide them with enough money for trading for goods How large could such a city become before it simply collapses due to the lack of infrastructure and government There are probably more considerations for a lawless town to function that Im overlooking so feel free to throw them in if you choose but I feel the biggest problem would be maintaining a flow of money without taxes etc People do live innear and trade with this town so they dont have to pay taxes but as there is no government they are generally at the mercy of bandits etc which is where caravan protection becomes a lucrative business But would it be enough

4883,worldbuilding, Im working out the back story of a flying castle run by a king who has a squadron of  air cavalry All the knights ride hippogriffs head and wings of large eagles bodies of horses Horses eat oats  Eagles eat meat  How do I calculate how large the grounds surrounding the flying castle need to be to grow enough oats and to supply enough meat lamb pork goat to keep the mounts fed My intent for the flying castle is not that it is a battleship  My intent is that there is a hemisphere of land which flies and the castle sits in the center  The land supports the castle inhabitants a thousand people with crops  So oats could be grown on the flying piece of rock around the castle proper  Technology level and tone is Age of Enlightenment with some magic  So roughly  to  Edit Im asking for help calculating the resources needed to feed the mounts I have an idea of how much land surrounds the castle to feed the thousand inhabitants inside a radius of two miles mostly fields with some small forests and hills The lands around the castle have enough resources fields to feed the inhabitants  The castle can send parties down to trade for resources and to forage Im trying to work out what can be provided locally and what will be a problem The castle is not a military team its a small town with a normal population distribution of a thousand people  Second Edit while the castle might be five hundred feet or less from the surface and be able to forage on the planet in times of peace Im trying to put together a plan for feeding the hippogriffs in times of war when forage is not possible and the castle is over the ocean or the frozen north  
4884,worldbuilding, Humans have achieved FTL and have colonized several planets in our greater stellar neighborhood While we have discovered several planets that harbor life as we know it we have not yet discovered other intelligent life However this isnt because we havent yet encountered it within the same stellar neighborhoods weve come to inhabit there exist one or more intelligent and technologically advanced civilizations none of which have yet become aware of each other or us It may even be the case that a single star system plays host to all of them simultaneously and they still havent found each other How do you keep FTLcapable intelligent advanced civilizations from noticing or even bothering each other EDIT Constraints The creatures themselves must be similar enough to humans that they could be easily recognized as intelligent if encountered inperson Individuals should be roughly similar in size to humans they could be as large as whales or as small as bugs but not for example microscopic or telescopic in scale

4887,worldbuilding, Im considering creating a fictional military organization designed in a highly organized and militarized manner such as you might find with the Norse of the th century if the Norse had developed space flight tanks and powered armor Some quick research left me with the impression that the rank structure of the Norse was very simple King nobleman freeman and slave  Rather than have slaves Im going to use thrall as the rank for anyone who doesnt enter the military I found  cultural ranks that could be used Jarl Heisir and Thegn and Im considering as an example having a Jarl command  boats of  soldiers each each boat is commanded by a Heisir and each group of  soldiers are commanded by a Thegn My question is are there other existing ranks or honor names Im looking for the words that could be used as military rank in a similar way  Please remember my basic groupings are king noblemen freemen and thralls

4920,writers, I find that when I write Im not always sure how to refer to the character of focus You can only say heshe so many times before it feels choppy and repetitive Constantly referring to character by name feels unnatural Ive tried using the profession of the character as well but sometimes that just feels wordy if it is unusual say if the character were a taxidermist Even with all the different ways to define the character you are describing action for is there any methodology for choosing which particular reference to that character you use as the passage progresses

4923,writers, I really wanted an unbiased opinion on how this poem is I need to submit it for an assignment  Cupid came to me An arrow he gave Asked me to shelter it Asked me to keep it safe Curious I asked What makes me so unusual That you want me to guard what is yours With no fear no hesitation He said he knew I craved To know what love does To know how it feels To be under its sweet curse I smiled and took the arrow Kept it safe from the world But one day LOVE showed up Upside down my life turned LOVE talked like honey LOVE smelled like flowers LOVE told me I was beautiful Inspite of all my flaws It was then I knew I couldnt keep the arrow For I wanted LOVE to keep it For every new tomorrow I gave him my arrow LOVE smiled his beautiful smile He examined it carefully But then his eyes turned hostile He struck my arrow Straight through my heart I could feel the pain gush up As I fell apart I looked at LOVE one last time Everything went still I saw Cupid as my eyes closed He smiled and said  Thats what LOVE does it KILLS

4931,writers, Ive had several people ask me why my fiction story does not have a table of contents I never really thought about it seeing as plenty of fiction stories do not have one either Is a table of contents mandatory or traditional in fictional writing Or is this like other writing rules where it can be broken based on different author style I am selfpublishing so I do not have an agent or publisher telling me what they want for the book My last editor did not seem surprised that my story did not have a table of contents either so I am looking for an official stance on this or a reputable source detailing what is expected in this type of writing Are there pros and cons to each way

4934,writers, I was holding off on doing this or possibly never doing it but now I am thinking of writing a memoir about prison My question is this How would you treat real names And if the author used aliases or didnt even know the real names of many inmatesas they are wont to use nicknameshow would a factchecker for the publisher even be able to know if the events took place I understand they can find out the basicswhat the authors crime was and how long they were incarcerated and where though I find it bizzare James Frey was not more thoroughly checked but everything else seems like it could be made out of thin air and that theres no way to find out the truth

4938,writers, A quick side by side comparison of two layout styles Left no indent and with white space right indented but no white space  Recently Im seeing more and more academiclike documents which are all written in the same style One of the characteristics Im seeing and really bugging me is that the first line of each paragraph is indented and has no white space above it And I really want to know Why If you ask me I find it ugly and it doesnt improves readability Perhaps the indent does but no white space between each paragraph is anything but increasing readability personal opinion  So again Why is the default of academiclooking writing stylespapers having indents and no white space Not only doctorgrade papers but related to all documents that apply indented paragraphs instead of white space between them

4949,writers, The newest version of the MLA manual came out in April and so the OWL Perdue website is technically out of date  Also additional websites including the Illinois State University page on citing government documents all differ quite extensively when it comes to requirements of citing US Government documents and what information you should include  I am reluctant to buy the new edition because even the official manuals are confusing concerning specifics of this detail  That being said I want to cite this document httpswwwgpogovfdsyspkgPLAWpublpdfPLAWpublpdf as is in the online version specifically  I am unsure whether it is important to note that it says Congressional Record on it which was mentioned in various university website guidelines something along the lines of If another agency published it you may not need to include GPO in your citations  Also how would I find out whether it was in print before it was published online  How would I note that it is an electronic reprint if it is  What does SJ Session  mean and is it necessary to include this info in the citation

4969,writers, Every online resource and forum seems to be emphasizing the importance of social media marketing for a book series I currently have two social media profiles Facebook Twitter and a personal website talking about my writing  My series is fictional focused towards the YA audience My first book has been in print and eBook for a year now with the second book in the series releasing at the end of this year  My main question is Besides social media what are other effective online methods of marketing a self published bookseries Also should I be focusing on the individual books themselves or try to market the series as a whole 
4970,writers, I was holding off on doing this or possibly never doing it but now I am thinking of writing a memoir about prison My question is this How would you treat real names And if the author used aliases or didnt even know the real names of many inmatesas they are wont to use nicknameshow would a factchecker for the publisher even be able to know if the events took place I understand they can find out the basicswhat the authors crime was and how long they were incarcerated and where though I find it bizzare James Frey was not more thoroughly checked but everything else seems like it could be made out of thin air and that theres no way to find out the truth  
4971,writers, Ive been writing fan fiction for  years now Recently I went back and compared the ratings my fan fiction has received from my readers compared to what they contained I discovered that those fan fictions with a distinct feel had generally better ratings and were in fact some of the highest rated things Ive written These include   A zombie story with a very dark atmosphere of despair and defeat  A war story with an atmosphere of useless struggle against the conflict   This research seems to indicate to me that I should focus more on finding and maintaining a specific feel for my stories There is however I problem how to do so  Im a very designoriented person I need structures and plans if Im to make anything This is no different I need a step by step process by which I can give a story a particular feel Can you provide me with such a process  Some feels will be easier than others I originally thought giving a story a feel would be fairly simple until I tried it Ive determined that my current fan fiction requires an atmosphere of desperation Not despair but desperation I know how to create an atmosphere of despair But how do I make the difference to desperation The feeling that people have been pushed to the edge and are willing to do literally anything The answer escapes me

4975,writers, Lets face it I like edgy writing that borders on inflammatory I read less for entertainment than I do for expanding my world view I dont have to agree with the points or even like the style of writing as long as it is well articulated Current fiction seems more focused on commercial success than it does on promoting dialogue or discourse with those having opposing views httpthehofstrachroniclecomprovocativewriterredefinesroleofnovelistbr I have started on my next novel that explores mental illnesses in the not too distant future The cast includes sociopathic gang members a detective with Asperger who is investigating the murders of psychiatrists and a cast of societal malcontents The premise is a cure is attempted on a psychopath who although innocent had a high potential for committing future crimes The cure initially manages to replace his core personality with a more normalized one but a traumatic event results in the creation of a dissociative identity the first an artificial one and the second the original psychopath who now seeks revenge against those who tried to obliterate his mind The real problem comes when describing outcast members using realistic terms People living in ghettos are apt to use politically incorrect dialogue I have one in particular that I think is accurate but also may be seen as inflammatory even though the character is a positive example  I have a scene where the witness to a crime is a transgender prostitute named Johnny Even using a transgender prostitute is edgy but having others call her a Tranny Hooker although accurate in ghetto talk may strike many as offensive even though the character loves that her appearance initially confuses the detective when he asks to speak to her companion The hooker laughs and explains he is Johnny and the detective may use the pronoun he if it makes him uncomfortable httpwwwslatecomblogsoutwardistrannyasluroranidentitywhodecideshtml As I said I am a provocateur and love writing that makes one question society norms There are many great historical writers who would surely be banned today simply for using descriptive words of their era Are there words too provocative for use in the current politically correct fiction markets

4977,writers, I plan at several parts of my book to have war chants done in the fictional language of my main racespecies  Would it be better to write the chant in their language  Put the fictional language with an english translation next to it Or is this something that should just go straight to english I thought I recall some of my fantasy books in the past doing one or both of the first  options but to me it is important that the reader is able to also understand the meaning to the words Most of my inspiration for my main species culture is drawn from the Maori the natives of New Zealand  This video would demonstrate what I mean by attaching the english words to a chant 
4978,writers,  This question already has an answer here   Where are standard wordcounts for different types of fiction found                       answers                     I submitted a query and was told my book is too short for mainstream publishing as it comes in around  words  Does anyone have feedback for how many words are needed or how to get a small book published
